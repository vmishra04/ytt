on the sensitive jain uncensored what happens when a beauty pageant get suddenly what about what kind of a giant centered on your toes chris jab all you know when i started comedy seo that exposes the things that the chinese guys party wants to keep under wraps never imagined it would spend so much time talking about beauty queens specifically ms worldspan that anastasia lane we know are we love her and she is an italy's know with who i am honey sit in on my show what dawson is that she's been using her miss world platform to expose human rights atrocities in china and i think miss world would be proud of someone like guest alien the u. k. based miss world the betting is in just about looks after all their motto is a beauty with the purpose they even got rid of the swimsuit competition as was the world's chairman julia morley said in an interview with elle magazine i don't care someone has the bottom two which is bigger than someone else's we're really not looking at her bottom and we are really listening to her speak that's a nice sentiments if the withdrew because when the bottom inquest seeing is ms world upon amaya speaking and suddenly gets more complicated easy on the misrule organizations sponsors appeared in the chinese companies i know little hard to see there because it's really really tiny they put it all away at the bottom of the website you know the way you do when you're really really proud of your sponsors since two thousand buried them is world finance had been held in china seven times mostly in the city of sign yet as on yon has put all lots of money in gym is world including the thirty one million dollar investment in infrastructure for the pageant last year sign yet pain is world four point eight million dollars to host the finals in their city and let them keep off hundred percent of the broadcasting fees paid by t. v. networks outside china so what happens when one of you jess is is that i don't know misguided by her values according to chinese state run media she gets a barred from entering china that's right the two thousand fifteen china refused to grant anastasia when all the zen calling her a persona non grata and chinese public security officers harassed her father who still lives in china and eventually bankrupted his company what did them is for old organization do kenny what could they do and i'll write their hands with high in the south there for the contestants somehow violated the host countries regulations for the candidate who speak out for it wasn't all bad though the media firestorm again for a new platform to speak out about human rights and she did at places like oxford university the national press club and he also freedom forum she spoke to the british parliament testifying from congress and met the dalai lama and she's also starring in a movie that was just released called leading edge of thriller about western companies taking huge sums of money to help china sensor is is is the cover up of course organ harvesting from hong kong practitioners i get that movies abandons shine out downloaded on itunes lying still can was ms world canada the kwanzaa i'm independent canadian division of the organization which stood up for anastasia when the first place decided to extend her title and at three year that way she can compete in this year's finals which for jimmy are being held in washington dc not china anyway this lady goes to washington and everything goes smoothly after that well if that were true you would be watching this episode right now is c. n. the missile organization is now itself actively silencing anastasia lane i'm going to the new york times had employees of war in her that she would be ejected from the competition if she spoke to reporters one of boston globe reporter took some initiative and intercepted her in her hotel lobby this world officials hosler wait while accusing her of causing trouble which is fine because chinese media have been given full access to interview the contestants that is world organization even try to block the u. s. state department official who wanted to meet with anastasia when they finally agreed but only on the condition that they got the police chaperone during the meeting and they forbid the state department for which we knew about the meeting in the nineteen and was ms world of benign anastasia permission to go to the permian all the bleeding and in washington dc so the british own beauty pageant is preventing the canadian beauty queen from talking about chinese human rights abuses on american soil here really is miss world it's not clear is that ms world organization is censoring anastasia because they've been pressured by the chinese government or their chinese sponsors or third is worried about possibly being pressured or losing money but it is clear that the organization itself is doing the censoring they can't blame it on the hosting countries visa requirements this guy but what's that telling wacko well it looks like things had changed just one day after everyone from the new york times because no reported on anastasia being silenced she's suddenly allowed to speak to the media again and even attend her movie premiere ideas that the arkin really turn things around you know many companies are clean enough to sell sensor or sons or fathers to be the chinese counties party were chinese mining and sometimes the only thing we can do is to call them out on a good old fashioned public shaming i often say this but bravo media for covering this but you know what i think yes david could use on even bigger megaphone golden we get to talk about this clancy would have to be somebody who has experience with the gadgets like seizing social media who enjoys shaming people and lingers chinese officials with big symbolic gestures okay idolatry thinking donald trump doesn't have the best track record when it comes to d. going that's what i still think he should meet with anastasia not in addressing or bosley of the chaperone but he is about to be the leader of the free world be like sitting there at the box he does reach winner and that we might just make chinese officials explode to seriously whether you love him or hate him tweed and donald trump right now tell him to meet with beauty queen hash tag anastasia when they talk about china be sure to gandhi and china uncensored so i can see your tweaks an everyday on that leave your comments blow and tell me what you think of this whole thing is lodgings at the vagina uncensored
