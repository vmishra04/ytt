luo welcome to the goods but again they did do is where we hid significance as to who and who the what and what forget it and how so when i when i was seventeen years old i was a book of poetry we need that poetry but i know hope that nobody will ever meet with punitive it the usual ambition of youth i thought that this was a wonderful book and in a chair when the book is published it's customary to have the oakland soon introduce the blue suit to the public and so i set about planning the book launch of this terrible book of poems how there was a powerful man in the media when you would help with this book want as life on my way into his office in vehicles i told him about my book which keeps the support the book i asked he was very impressed he told me why all of that teenagers were hiking heating up call i was serious and often focus tunnels are freaking double he was pleasant avuncular war and then he got so from his desk and walked around to where was he said and he stood behind me and we felt was a swift passage was shocking to stick his hand on my book and down sheriff's on to my bra and squeezed my breast i was so taken aback that did nothing for seconds then i pushed his hand away but gently nice because i didn't want to offend him they get in that book into a rash on my chest my neck my face us who might but you were pointing us alive but he was saying what my boots had not said i felt that he would know one thing for that matter for what he didn't confess affected math sas if my buddy it's that many of the thing to be done with us he wants it yet they told no one about that i kept talking to him being polite hoping he would help with my book i was a feminist long before new with the woodman as i didn't beat feminists path i just simply want to war i knew that the wall to the o'keefe to women distinctiveness is that against him and i was aware of how what the socialization of women is focused on man dorrance wear miniskirts them on repeat them to cook and clean so you can keep them out don't be too want to show us so you don't intimidate him and don't always see what you really think so that you can protect shymanski who i've felt hats and by the meat see movement because it means that finally women's stories of being paid me it because they're not real consequences for the men will harass women because for too long women did not tell this jury is because they felt that they wouldn't even be to all that you want some help and lead but what is unhappy about the consequences may now face an increasingly find myself thinking about the women how do we think about restitution these restitution even possible how do we measure resentment how do you measure the complexity of women's experiences we are after all human beings when most of collection of logical balloons and finance we are emotional needs more tv shows are not always easy measurable ortiz and put the fire has sold for me he says the story the merits in that can be deemed to be each these soft laugh and unnecessary parts of women's experiences we should change channels that diminish women but changing mindsets is as important we should enact policy that supports women would changing called shortcut succeeds the single most important while i've been very happy we've had is the what the world can use above me to movement about nixon but also falcon sense of of the way it's been called by the media and by the abstract language often used in the media saying the u. s. i would read the news and think one of sexual misconduct be exactly what did the story i wanted to see it because the system intending that creates context it is the story that provides a kind of teeth healed up and educates people but it seems to me that we all need some education and subject of sexual harassment it is the story that makes it difficult to science women it's a story tending with all of its new ones from all of its complexity that can make clear the defense the two sexual harassment and what isn't sexual harassment that can make clear that with sexual harassment happens is much more about how that it is about sex i met him to study attending that can make clear that we met know what the difference between what says consensual and what is not i hope that meets old become the beginning of a real revolution wanted to end with women finally find any being fooled autonomous human beings and walls but they still so much wanted to this wonderful to have laws that expectant father to take time off to care for new child which i hear happens is and you can reach an but how does society meeting think of that man who takes the most of the city to the batman his teeth while the woman wants to win me seize of whom he mutual is domestic walk be the gender neutral or two women still to the charity of its politics of domestic arrangements much as very much because the schools around women on wall is really optimistic or if the tradition of expectations were not that cake in a domestic worker marital women then there will be no need for us to have conversations about can a woman have it all because we never speak about whether a man can have it all the teachers my religion i never learned from the kitchen that all of us human beings of fuel and animals on their level of laws of the pulse of the lives of redemption we can we make the walls like the fact we can remake must unity we can change it from the smell of key that traps men into humi ninety we can expect men to the former opal we can give amendment which of emotion we can't teach men to respect that one of women we can encourage you to voice the crime we can create to wall where women can be fooled sexual beings wakes up she never happens where we men face no backlash for being bold for being angry you for being aggressive or for being an ambitious we concrete wall with that many women in the u. positions of power because representation that we can make wall where we all collectively supports those human beings whose blood used to the difficult and physical walk of ensuring that the human species the small become extinct and how that happened when the house you'll go to and i really hope that believes in the wall that's better than wall that i'm leaving thinking how then did into with friends and so you just throw the journal poll
