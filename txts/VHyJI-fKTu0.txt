so what taco bout some abstinence before marriage and let me just say that this is a bit beyond is is not some buses not a religious conversation i'm not gonna go moral arguments that non religious people in other like to dismiss these kinds of these kinds of discussions had because they say was that just religious subjects which fundamentalist by the mascot of bosnia let's go ironic because nice those same non religious people also insist that you do not need to be religious in order to act with wisdom and prudence and all that's religious people don't have a monopoly on that bell said well saving sex for marriage is without question or wisest and most prudent path out with any rational person would deny dad's bombed out or ten denied convincing with yet it is a wise and prudent have that we are told is only open to the religious i disagree with that i guess i have a higher opinion i guess but not rule is the golan honor little bit while themselves because iowa but i'll say about what yeah it's true that religious people generally believe in savings extra marriage but it would do believe in its bomb ideal you how successful yarn followers result of rather blood on it so true they believe it but it's not true that you have to be religious or to see the wisdom in such a strategy bomb and i think if you wish to address our most serious social problems bomb if you if you does it do you desire the benefits that could go on from solving these problems then and then you should advocate for absence before marriage whether you're religious or not at all doesn't matter this is a practical position out and maybe a spiritual position as well but that's not know that you keep those two things don't necessarily have to be linked all the time like i also believe that some bad that murder is wrong and that is a i i i believe that spiritual it nobly withdraw august tenth melman says the gerard is god's as a drop by tom but what i would still bully on still had to get along homicide you know the tandem m. is that exists and i would i would hold that position for very obvious and practical reasons right well i think the same is true of bomb saving sex for marriage alive and i'm not comparing know about the prairie dogs are two former airs tomorrow just adding that the obit this is a busted you can make a very practical arguments in favor of it i'm an avid anyone can see the benefits both that path and anyone can scooper sure about our regardless of religion so now all well what does all the talk about the grades on societal those graces aisle crises that could be solved or lease greatly of bread juice by keeping sex within the framework of a monogamous a lifelong marriage sonatas saving it a lot of sunlight us anything about sin or avoiding hello or anything like that to defer discussion from a one-on-one grabber now on the part of the temporal parietal benefits of the scores and i think that you're it's a very difficult thing when we look at our cultural problems and we said our willis all these problems but then at the outset we rule out the most effective solutions that it's in that we're always going to others like it was the fundamental basic solution that it's right to the root of the problem we rule that out we'll was real those solutions out because those are like style solutions those are solutions or core sex sacrifice not for our work is one rule goes out with that are not not not that what what looks fine so bewildered further up on the tree right away again we don't know what looks like a solution of old further up your um butler would go closer to the service will be more superficial and therefore easier than i'd just all they'd and stole the works of the weather gets overlooked and got him to the mat silhouette of the salsa which brought up on all night long ago sir luster of fuel problems that could be salt or the said produced an erotic by saving sex for marriage abroad pretty obvious fatherless mess that bomb there there are basically three ways that child can end up enough fatherless child one is divorce or talk about that i'm at the other is death about this when we get back get assaulted in any in any way so that the dollars are being measured on by both of those categories are the minority in fact the number of never marry single mothers edison officer got pregnant out of wedlock that number is greater than the number of divorced and widow single mothers combined okay so fatherless nuts and all of the a terrible consequences are come with it resenting drug abuse bomb no drop at a school although the mental health problems in all these things but that that many times them for bottles all that can be gotten half furrow abstinence number two bob divorce so divorce itself minutes ago when the kid why bob bennett has an old guard called and our divorce itself if we say upsetting sex for marriage as society that could greatly reduced divorce studies have consistently shown that marriages between people was never a sexually what anyone else virgin marriages were called on those are less likely to lead the force the marriages between previous essentially active people that even marriages between people who were previously sex we act of all it with each other so cohabitation no i'm able to google habits aides were shackled together before getting married those arrived on more likely going to divorce bankable through on your answer before marriage and that would together before three bombing poverty so now we can tie together that the first two items on less civil fact the matter is this to sex every clear on this children or four times as likely to be impoverished if they live in single parent homes on the statistics are there are the only eight percent of children in mary households or pour all over forty percent of children and single parent households the bliss single mother households are before the cry when that is a big credible success that almost half of the kids was an oak barrels are park or whatever tiny minority been married households work for a bite i think maybe i may get something we should look at and considering the most of those children were born to unwed mothers the connection between poverty and sex before marriage bathing suit birdie on number for stds bomb bui are clearly experiencing and sta beata demagogue and trade sex and transmitted diseases are at record highs across the contrary are more reported cases of clemente on more cases of the of gonorrhea more cases of surplus of less than ever before and here again obviously is as sex merger of cordoba's to two people of sex bomb to save sex for marriage and aidid sex within marriage but i have the warden is probably all against the glass off the stars are concerned up or not so the waterfall thank god we're we're we're in the coming year the committed marriage and ardor of faithful marriage to the wonderful but it all ports at attica nosair not not a problem not an issue right i'll make number five abortion according to the good doctor institute which is a pro abortion centered on only fourteen percent of women reporter abortion wester were by means of the abortion rate could be caught by a date but six percent of sex for sex for marriage at another six oz sexual assaults i think could be greatly reduced by saving sex for marriage not obvious laid out getting there is gonna protect the woman absolutely from getting raped bob woodward climate bought 'em i think this treasure would reduce the problem in the places like college in all but your college campus and other environments for assault often occur within the context of a boost your old uncle got colder sold a woman can significant would not completely but significant when insulators off from from that risk by withdrawing herself from that scene and carl and it will go call drawer abolished the obit it didn't exist anymore gotten to that the problem of of sexual assault uncle scabs is what i read all but disappear now i know that there were spot so so what's the response that knew everything are committed by adding business and bricklayer order in britain prepare illogical for a bomb then as there is there's no denying that said that these problems could be a bizarre it did really addressed by selling sex for marriage what's the ordinary ganz the ban well people say i will say what i know you could solve most news problems with with safe sex right justice use contraception in to get rid of a mostly skulls but here's the thing and and and and a corollary to that as alert as well no weak so we have to make contraception birth control the republican more available the people saw that that will cut down on these issues but is there something about that contraception is already readily available everywhere know anyone can obtain some form of birth control for low cost or no cost so the idea that we need better access to birth control is just a it's idiotic anyone can go and a gas station and a convenience store any drug store penney walmart and target at a grocery store and the contraception for very cheap and a beginning to cover for him in any medical clinics how much more accessible can it possibly be how much more accessible do you need a debate we need the government that the startling airdrops literally the bobbing back so condoms from that from the helicopter is like that do we need to send out the end of the national guard to cities across america at a crawl across america in a helicopter so that's a condom just condoms is dropping them sprinkling them across the ground or the morning dew drop so that we want to also the mortgages did the woodard with birth control pills and i looked would that be acceptable about doctor weaver at all then when that's not accessible about the son of access what the hell out that i needed and so when out and to walk into my house every morning anyplace birth control into my head and that's the offer for you that's the only way old excess wanted to just it it's ridiculous it is in this stuff is extremely accessible people talk about birth control on the conflict with a good estimate as suit say that the three birth control the birth control it covered by their new culture and suffer for your whether they talk about birth control is if you need six thousand dollars and some kind of certification some sort of why since the baht condom you don't it's ridiculous this stuff is sober available and super cheap gets as to the eraser skyrocketing there the store cards fava was message problem out of work that out of wedlock births bomb is a huge problem all borsch newt and bob and these problems are all wore snell then or fifty years ago on birth control really was hard to come by higher yields plane that i mean we should see it if it were if access to birth control is gonna solve these problems considering birth and draw has become much warrick says so ball or the nearest we should be able to look at short all these other problems the guest is bombed out of wedlock births etc and we should note while birth control to win as the problem should be doing that right that's what we should say what if there's an actual but that's not always sit in fact a lot of problems is more like this and go back to believe that that's something that the it's none of the gerson as it may be the there's no such a thing as safe sex outside of the bonds of a committed marriage you know or do we need another fifty years of evidence before we conduct inclusion we get another fifty years of our logo showing birth control but never once the roads announcing his problems not only get worse we both agreed but come on which the homage war bond would need for windstar drawings and obvious conclusion maybe it'll may be safely having sex with a stranger in a meadow party is about as possible as safely driving drunk you know mom but you can mitigate some of the risk basam expands by wearing a seatbelt if you're driving drunk the denuded by natuna we'll go clark and when plastered on you might say it's it's safe for the closing bell and just as you can mitigate some of the risk to some extent by wearing a condom but the act itself in both cases is fundamentally rock was dangerous and so really the only safe course of action is to just not do it talked about or sank the sixteen year olds which yet succeeded bill weber and soft war two years my school hours and then you did or this and that could directly result in pregnancy alive faltering diseases do it safely and for us safe means taking the drawbridge in a device double hopefully hopefully to insulate you may be from some of the echo of backs of the act and again we should consider is there is no safe sex bossard from sex with your spouse there's no substitute for self-control discipline to believe there's no good argument against self-control discipline and the bell it on the the fact that those things require africa but that's not an argument as just a complete on when one woman mentioned up one of those and it'll save it but some actions before marriage is is unrealistic and help for so i could just as well say that safe sex is unrealistic because obviously a lot of people just are willing to take those precautions i mean you talk was safe sex all you want her to clear away all injured many people are are just not are not condone it so can i make same arguments i didn't answer the same sex than is unrealistic and an acrobat i also issued a role in her blood that some of that but just because a solution is challenger doesn't mean that you're all stacked the fact that it's challenging is evidence that it's right because there are no easy solutions for difficult problems if life has taught us anything is that you cannot salt difficult problems is all it is the solution is easy that's a good indication it's not real solution so when someone says on the assault your obesity with uphill all that sounds great but some of those doubt it and so on a couch in whatever you want make no changes here isabel salter obesity that supporting the nikkei that's in the battle with gold too good to be true if a person solution for obesity does not include a diet and exercise than their solution may be fine but it's not a good solution on in i think that principle holds just bring much with every big problem in big bump so so there's a bought oh that i will admits that as things are currently southern society abstinence before marriage as things are currently so called with our with our society the way it is now absent before marriage is an extremely difficult proposition bob kittle called because humans your way we work as though we develop spent and sexual desire to cover puberty which is around thirty or so but the average age of marriage for men is almost guardian for women it's almost twenty eight sold sold so to be abstinent before marriage requires according to the average trajectory it requires fifteen years of celibacy on an oath fifteen years happen to be the fifteen years with the desire for sex is the strongest and also abdullah society or sex is being put to the as this causeway ever get so it is indeed quite a bit quite a big thing to ask of somebody no good books by the guy who go through fifteen years stealing the intense desire for fizzled banish above what with women and i n. n. in the midst of a sex crazed call jerk any gets remain celibate all caught up that is a bad bad bad so bad so big thing to do ask and somebody and most people are able to do that are not willing to do it so on so so they become sexually active years and years before marriage is even on the table is such as that becomes a second before marriage becomes actually out there before marriage is even disease and no possibility and then we have all these problems on mention before and so then what's the solution will here's what get married earlier all of this idea of waiting forever to get married he is very new it's a very western about this idea that some marriage should be kind of there and the capstone of young adulthood again very new very western it's not the way it used to be a marriage was the foundation the cornerstone of young adulthood which you got married right in the beginning of young adulthood and and it was it was and boost and upper step in the drawer of adulthood and then for married and everything else about a new study and now we've taken it would put at the very it and on this is not our ancestors hamlet image of the nineteen sixties an average age of of marriage for women was twenty for medalist water water twenty two and this also would know that makes a lot more sense biologically well because a woman's them all and most fertile incorrect age range is twenty to twenty four and enter fertility declines dramatically in her thirties but now all we wait until our stories to get married men ever ever was wondering then why they get the prank at an hour while we are brought on over to liquids are linked to what what what's going on nobody get pregnant while because everyone is spending the most fertile period having sex with strangers and one eighth why why settle in with a spouse and the sale of start them like they can't anymore i may just as all strategy makes no sense of the that work it's dysfunctional on every level it is the the way that we approached sex and religion jobs and marriage is dysfunctional it's not working bad it's just there's no it's not for her to look at the evidence i'm so even though i don't know is is an album i did or really talk about real solutions will we would start advocating for one hundred other two thirds ashes before marriage had earlier marriage would last word but for that if we do for real losers about it because it is here's here's important for there is no solution to these problems that those not include a drastic lifestyle change on an address the cultural judge that there is no solution that will lead in all spotted bills for minimum need to to make those kinds of drug telling everyone use contraception that's not a cultural trends ozawa style ginger and so that's what's on working because are these problems stand strong not dog not just on this list is acquitted began with the sexual act but what a deeper level this damn fromm certain lifestyle choices that we made now and cultural attitudes that we have about marriage sex relationships with the change of attitudes in those those lifestyles you know and again afford not willing to do that before ruling that out as a possibility that we're just not a softens problems when one falls apart on on our lives or just accept that an you'd thought was as a ploy want but could be aboard the use condom nobody's got wet and were what job and hours and in one way or another look what one way or another it is if we are if we are just accepting that people are gonna have sex for fifteen years ago for leverage married a bill that dumb or just accepting the fact always brought into the bargain or come so what sorrow real solutions that's my ombudsman proposal and i don't know nobody's got but nobody but the thorough colonel peck that fortune about effects listening and other gray wig and godspeed
