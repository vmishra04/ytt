one akashi you people who speculate about several investigations have usually do not know all of the relevant facts that i've tried cases on television for a congressional here is the most anonymous leaks are not from the government officials for actually conducted these investigations of resolve law fish means that we follow the procedures that we reserve judgment deputy attorney general ron rosenstein fired be not so veiled shot at republicans will announce in the indictment of a dozen russian intelligence officers accused of an attack on the twenty sixth election now political report house conservatives are preparing to a plan to push rosenstein out the report says that how freedom caucus chairman more meadows had the impeachment document gets on health or at the very moment that rosenstein spoke to some conservative source says that saved them to their sources say make about the impeachment back with us tomorrow back with me natasha verified their frederick the atlantic also joining our date corn washington bureau chief of mother jones and paul bottler law professor at georgetown the covering your david the washington post is reporting that robert mahler is racing base to push me finish parts of russia probe is a quote question of american involvement remains as resented this week mahler's tina's discuss intervene more witnesses assign a car that probably very active first play with blair said that he's pointing to now get to the american potentially in the indictment in this congress house conservatives are prepping to try that shut out right rosenstein also fromm believe this is awful lot of our political coverage for think about impeachment is as soon as monday so his error rates on now when you're reporting for mahler to finish substantial part of his parole before potentially abbasi its fire on a single word words of the people said his schedule are really don't i think this is a long complicated than that investigation are meant to be other business aspects to this this nation is a lot that we've seen that we know about before and our rosen though hassan is right when he says that even old people we don't know don't know and so are my god this is putting pressure morgan move quicker with is doing the showing the house conservatives workman's june jordan anybody's seems to watch fox news are really living in all truth is bizarre reality to them the most important thing is o. pfizer's surveillance warrant that peter structure of might've been involved with which it's been ten pro hours on the earring and not the fact that russia's attacked the united states that milly gets attacked him in its attack the downtrodden to talk about joy cover not be knew about it he was told about during the campaign gives a kidnap and those are the big picture items here and there has been there really was to their own little world and at some point the two worlds will clash yeah let us fight your shop in front of the joint hearing he was actually quite badly hurt the defense of itself is one of the things he said to you very point david i have the utmost respect for connor says oversight role but i strongly believe today's hearing is just another victory not shimbun his belt of another milestone in our denise campaign to tear america part they made your point out a understand that or do they care about that i can tell no they understand they certainly don't care about it i'm reading every uncle is that is on tv the sorensen agreeable saying and what does it look as if the russians and of your mind at the i. it's hard to avoid the word treason i'd like to end towards treachery yeah the beginning that aid and comfort to an enemy that attacked us and then handed in fact it is listed as this is an impact on the origin and republicans who really don't seem to care and i think is the same fading in your reporting do republicans rank in file elected republicans care that russia attacked our election in two thousand feet away the only harsh statement that we've seen so far has of course been from senator john mccain has initial don king is the one pushing back against russia and saying the president said prioritize this guy the revelation that twelve russian intelligence officers hacks indian see happen the triple say and if he wanted his meeting with hidden and if he does not if he doesn't plan to any nation be canceled and of course you have not hot upon a democratic senators coming out and saying this meeting should be canceled and should not be what i wanted to but in terms of the republicans coming out making is virtually the only one that sounds came out of the statement that you know criticize implicitly not by name the criticize tromp essentially for character asynchronous of one who could be our friends yeah but as of right now what we're saying is his attack on peter shock which is just at the rear ring circus that entire hearing him yeah very personal attacks and you now and they're preparing to impeach right rosenstein have of course just announced the indictment of it seems like they're doing everything that they can to put the brakes on this investigation because they feel that the noose is tightening if it's taking her on the president it's of course tightening around the republican party because they have been complex and all of this area in allowing the president to you can't get away with his his open arms of course why we're in his strange all that there he is is not enthusiasm for what happened because of the outcome was favorable to what republicans wanted at least any difference to his bizarre we're seeing is what our public in a broad rosenstein so new seats the tire being appointed back on this a. b. so i think both he came out this weekend said i know it's time for bed at some point he made a decision on both of you to stay within the ethical boundaries again if they would be a punching bag said jane stress the former justice department is to lose friends of rosenstein b. c. will steal the spine every now and then when he says seventy keep doing it my way in your view can in attempt to impeach this man who we've been dining if the people attacked our election against remember that even dining at any one impeaching can that work in a signal would join that will buttons know there's a lot more evidence to support the impeachment of donald j. trial them raw rolls and start and wrought rules of the line is feeling themselves so we saw the clock back on friday at that press conference you're reminded me of one thousand obama says there are no red stains or whose lives just the united states brought rolls and spies are warned friday when the russians are attacking the united states there's no public jones or democrats for all americans and then he says president clark needs to wanders there in other words new origin they were always this week in you being with whom that that man's right now to us over our democracy you've only because the items are marvels there was nothing bipartisan love all the russian power for they know what for the democrats to try to install donald trump as president yeah and and tell me this play that it does to the point at fault is making as ron roses on friday i would call bullock autocrat back with us we follow the rules law if which means that we follow procedures that we reserve judgment the investigations that we evaluate all of the relevant evidence before we reach any conclusions as to the american people expect further part of justice to operate in that is now part of town is going to have lived there at what like a backyard your fourth paul butler id prosecutor in a position of ross perot societies in he has explained one of our party itself how do they continue to operate with this kind will pressure were essentially one political party has said the investigation itself is a crime engines stop no matter what any of these uncovering an profit operate in that situation in or you just do your job you understand there you have to submit to these congressional hearings were again car was is so salinas oversight role in a mirror a bipartisan way they're trying to protect the president so unfortunately brought rosen's plight is an opposition were heroes to regard the reformers is basically a supplement to the president's defense team yes it is really difficult position it's also one presses and bertha ties and indeed it even in this indictment of the progress is an issue to talk about the fact that the russians also when after the r. n. c. do or how could in your reporting have offensively understand that as marco rubio said during the campaign to behave the russians want help republicans tomorrow they can while attacked republicans the republican understand that i think that all you have to look at the answer that question is the fact that you had a republican senator delegation go over to moscow during the week at the fourth of july the fourth of july the fourth of july they're actually they're meeting where high level officials high-level kremlin officials why i mean we still don't really know why was it a with it at the notes here to discuss that upcoming summit between chopping and that was a thing really don't understand why that happened was it to better relations between the u. s. and russia that means what this morning and members of the forgot our armed services committee i four members of that on you know the intelligence committee these were just senators you decide to go over there can take matters into their own hands a question as to whether or not they understand that the russians might have compromising information on that right of course they did have conspiracy maniac is part of the reason why the other ministers pure speculation this point is we just don't understand the rice and how i can think when the baby you've got bollinger phoebe down from the very beginning as well to do the washing his habit of potentially leverage over the republican party between what they did with the n. r. a. in terms of of funneling money what will work how because of the week when you were probably the russians have leverage on them is while again it's hard to know how what republicans are thinking about this because i'm acting in a highly rational member secondary transaction winner situation with the way the trunk does whatever it seems to work for them for the moment to protect trial because they feel that their interest all we do know that the russians have the capability and surly of penetrated the republicans to some degree but the hour what's why they're doing what they're doing it just seems to me that the gym jordan's of the world dear we're back comes in very close to one for a long time now have just decided that they need to do whatever they can to protect donald trump and his own treachery and that's what's driving them at the moment yeah that protect them at all cost any kana reserve rod rosenstein christopher's the appeal if i were to have not proven and not only when it sees the right larry i natasha they're trying baby corn all but a few opry should have a great rest of your day coming out to think you've got five at least let with fate of a healthy to key democratic senator farr why he wants that meeting canceled thigh pay for
