the mid nineteen nineties he became a master at showering get some lawmakers in return for their votes on legislation and tax breaks favorable to his clients he was so glad that he took home twenty million dollars a year in all came crashing down five years ago jack in vermont pled guilty to corrupting public officials tax evasion and fraud and served three and a half years in prison today he's a symbol of how money corrupts washington in our interview tonight he opens up his playbook for the first time explains exactly how he used his client's money to buy powerful friends and influence legislation the story will continue in a moment ourselves or hinted that i couldn't figure out what went wrong was i believe that i was among the top dead people on the business i was horribly boarded by what was going on jack gave 'em off was a wizard influencing legislation and one way he did that was to get his clients like some indian tribes to make substantial campaign contributions to select members of congress as i look back it was effective it certainly helps people are destroyed help of the clients and the republicans of that but even that was a year now saying was correct yes can you quantify how much it costs to corrupt the congressman pat if that is actually pretty writing a book ivy is guided by a covers of bad as a way to put this all about that for slapping most potent of the living off of those colors i think can in the room mind just as i ran us son rational and zimbabwe we want is not news to them they feel that way you can run off would provide freebies and gifts are looking for favors risk clients in return he lavish certain congressmen and senators with access to private jets and john gets to the world's great gulf destinations like saint andrews in scotland free meals in his own upscale washington restaurant and access to the best tickets to all the areas but it's having to skyboxes have washington redskins that has been said over a million dollars a year on tickets to sporting events and concerts what not that old thing is we are not the best seats that essays by at two people on my staff was brutal full time job was looking tickets we were ticketmaster for these guys brenda a congressman or senator could take his favorite people from his destructive devices are about to take her to doesn't this favour people from their district was all that we go we would certainly for lying to make the activity legal if we got the times we didn't tear gas play together congressional office to do his bidding he says was too hot for us that for a job they could travel his salary when we become friendly with an office they weren't in guys and the chances that was a cop a person i would say who are my step would say i'm rick some point you know when you're done working on the hill we very much like you to consider common or perhaps but the melinda said that to them or any of our staff said that and abu zayed we don't know was that in every request from our office every request of our clients everything that we won't they are in the end no way that they're the good things and and they got to do jackie vermont's we thought the dollar from the truck that's a persuasive people it's neil falls was one of the staffers and i'm off was talking about he was chief of staff to congressman bob nanny who was chairman of the house administration committee had considerable power to dispense favors in grandma's targeted rolls and offered him a job you're the chief of staff of a powerful congressman and jack calms you haven't even laughed working for the cars why i'd i have a distinct memory of the negotiating with jack and hockey game so we're in a just a few rows back the crowd's going crazy injecting i've checked out of business conversation and knock on on wrestling with how much i think if you get paid and five minutes letter word he's asking the questions about some clients it's when you look back was that the co opting moment ago we were guilty of engaging in current relationship so there were several corrupting moments as in just one moment there were many at the end of the day most of people that i encountered worked on capitol hill wanted to come work on k. street wanted to do obvious you're telling me this ingenious figuring out you could only office by offering a job to the changes that say i'm having to reactions when is brilliant and the other isn't sick to my stomach but even that terrible cousins aunts headed our country absolutely is the worst thing that happened well planned and i was led allied as head of the lesley look tidy things that i wasn't all the system why should not have been made by machine but the fact that was there the very reason why now i'm speaking about it and no one trying to do something to recompense is the fact that i thought it was it was well it needed that one of the offices heaved yeah i was that it is good for ad the majority leader tom delay financially hiring his deputy chief of staff and his press secretary and going into business with the lady's chief of staff did you on his staff i was i was as close to his death is danny's death i have got a very strong social relations lot of his death how many congressional offices to do actually who did the we probably had very strong influence in a hundred offices of uh-huh calm them behind him and this in those days are with you that as if at resemblance to the five boxes that we didn't have strong influence him to be on you to leave jacking off on me but we're re involved in the culture of corruption together absolutely former republican congressman bob name was ambitious you look at a run off as a way to build alliances with the white house and the majority leader won't be speaker of the house and jacket vermont was the beautiful light of day for me to get to the person whitehead some conflicts with tom delay a runoff began inviting a on golf troops including one to scotland and to his restaurant signatures were name was given food and drinks on the house of violation of the congressional budget when it wants he says he was hardly the only one crossing the line by will still tell you at that point in time in order to get a drink it signatures you had to shout white house staffers of george bush then get away from the bar and it was packed with people when they were members of this nearby did everything for jack but what about strict interpretation of violation of the debatable was a drink and food katie bar the door she was wide open two shotguns one who after months of taking handouts me was approached by neil voles his former chief of staff night and all lobbyist for abrams how much you can live at fall to mask a nanny to insert some language into law reform bill that would give up that your license to an indian casino owned by one of the paper most clients are only want to hear about lobby is getting special secret deals for their clients like this it's insidious technique that avram i've perfected so what we did was we crafted language that was so obscure so confusing so unimportant but so precise to change the u. s. catholic here's what you try to get right hack that to this reform the public law one hundred cash eighty nine is a man dead by striking section two of seven grand one hour winds that period six six eight common six seven to close current medicine that obviously that means that it was both at us for so that's what you tried to get answer that yes and i was gonna provide for casino yes and who on earth is gonna know that no one except the chairman of the committees was that can yes and that's one of the things you used today yes it was the liberal wing red and white that precisely yes let's donilon members don't read the bells in you know what was for had no idea in the week that the riddle language i didn't know who is for bad ideas and i didn't care oh and the big shell game and i was in the middle of it whether or not knowing or not i i was dominant not say what sizzling the house yeah a would eventually served seventeen months in federal prison the only congressman was ever charge in the scandal that a grandma says there were many other members the disputing that could've been charged was buying favors from lawmakers easy i think people are the impression that the corruption the windfalls somebody he a virtue acting getting a favor and that's not it is not the corruption the barbary call focus was absolutely that's what it's that's what the whole says all systems bribery back in my view i'm talking bout giving a gift to somebody who makes a decision on behalf of the pot that the end of the day that's really what bribery has been used on every day and is still be in the truth is the very few members who like indicted even a power could think about bob colgate and at some level the dissipate and and you come up prided himself on being a man who did good oil he was devoutly religious an exorbitant charitable he says he gave away the percentage is earnings but when he fell from grace his reputation was in tatters because it was not just that he had corrupted congress he was found cheated cheated his clients like the indian tribes most allele i'm a guy gave way to come in or charitable causes assad thought i was likely outcome is one of the most loyal audience out there things began to unravel favor i'm off with the washington post published largely on flattering portrait of him in two thousand one reporting that he charged his clients ten times more than any other lobbyist in town my first response was what's the big deal honors them what this is about of clothes want instead of what he didn't understand was the pod has said he and a former aide to tom delay and overbilled for office indian casino clients by forty five million dollars in me and he was brought up on federal charges of tax evasions back and letting off indian tribes it on the day he heard the word and pled guilty in waffle to graham judge sentenced him to four years i really think when you were doing was was subverting the essence of us that absolutely right that our system is flawed and has to be that's human beings populate our system human beings are we knew preyed on why did i was one of many u. did i didn't i'm ashamed of that that was sent to a medium security facility in cumberland maryland when he was really slash june he began working as an accountant the kosher pizza parlor turns out jack abrams off was broke partly because he's paying off nearly twenty four billion dollars in restitution to the indian tribes today he lives in his old house in maryland with his wife or five children and neptune doberman pincher is mrs able modified to protect the family while he was away on after the scandal congress instituted a package of reforms making what avram off didn't like flying members of congress with forty expensive meals illegal but he hasn't seen the new reforms as being very affected the best former efforts continually are are the use of bow with former efforts were they'll change the books weaknesses and say you can have in your book the cover slip for standing up not sitting down as an serious serious japan are not much of it okay if you pay for much as long as you stand up was actually worse than that the ticket taker kirsten to launch for twenty five dollars by a hamburger or state or some of that got you can take him to fund raising lunch and not only by in that state budget enjoyed five thousand dollars lecture in cotton fibers and all the same access to all the same god interaction that congressman so that people who make the reforms of the people in this system could you tell the same thing today i'm asking what you think this is the as a queen that i have no this isn't hasn't been cleaned up the ball well there's an elegance from our law this is really there wasn't part of me it might then the they call bob what were swarming all over calm and we're just one of the way proof that's all he says the most important thing that needs to be done is to prohibit members of congress and her staff from ever becoming lobbyist in washington you make the choice to serve the public of public service and so the public not yourself when you're gonna go all washington's a dangerous place don't hang away for a macabre zimbabwe now works part time as the radio host is for jesus daphne almost is conley working as a night janitor at a florida restaurant and jack gave 'em off has written a memoir called capital punishment
