to feed his yet how does that if a thumbs gone on lace gentlemen of the vote was supposed to take place at one thirty berets a sense that grassley would've taken a motive he had the votes and jeff like he's been hiding in the engine room tom said to them that is not to bring others to go to sell on the star just like right now it is one forty six pm eastern standard time jeff lake has already announced as of this morning right used in a vote yes in the committee for our cabin however something's something's holding up the boat jeff lake is in the edit room outside talking to people we know that brian do we know that that joe donnelly is our denounced the voting against we know that the dow jones from alabama going against and this is why jeff like would've heard on c. n. n. this morning from the fairly like a typically reserve to cut this couple c. n. n. commentators tom jeffrey toobin on their jeffrey toobin is tom would deftly describe move self as a liberal but he also is like a bomb you know a legal guy and they tend to be i'm less partisan and there's a lot of like buddy's got a great legal mind and they know there's always that type of thing that big ozawa guys like it's probably jeffrey toobin was rather pointed today in his criticism of one jeff like that and jeff like having a call for the hearing didn't even bother uses five minutes for one minute he started settle this is very sad and if there is a week or more pathetic political figure in the united states and jeff away i'm not aware of what is and i thought yesterday was a classic demonstration of his inability to stand for anything your office like family christmas list why aha yeah i mean but that's a pretty appointed statement for you know sir if someone is you been up until fairly recently been getting plaudits for being gay no tough enough to stand up to donald trump and you know to the thing with these politicians is they the the establishing bryant and even if what the east part of their brand goes against what their constituents wanted any given time they stayed true to their brand because they think that's what was the day came to allow to their mom mom their voters and say hey i know you don't like that but this is july am and there's a there's a certain amount respected voters get to that they cannot agree with the molokai but he says would you believe sir she says when that that thing and so they huge of their brain and at the cinema jeff white males of feel like he as a personal brand even if it is a good abuses senator in the future and maybe start realizing this doesn't them a person brandon lee ca myette maybe my slippery show it i'm but we shall see that that was a jeffrey toobin at what's going to be i'm ought to what we have in terms of footage from yesterday in an animal take some phone calls and takes your items i am now are warming up the i. m. machine as we speak ladies and gentlemen on let's go to palm some of the law it's the obvious lies that debra cavanagh talk about we've mentioned this way them with eddie go out but i'm here is a cavanagh talking to our sheldon white house whose blumenthal isn't this number three okay hard to this is on the outside this is a blumenthal and blumenthal starts off a sitcom question in iraq we have it in this clip by the high as a former prosecutor from connecticut says that i'm sure you're aware of the yom the concept and it's a black man so forgive me my lads hurry rusty tom all of you tell one lie there all life is this is where the witness gets dismissed the war is said to the jury instructions to be you know have to listen to that any the testimony or or what order this way if the witness it's been determined that the witness lied about one thing impeaches all of their testimony and so a blumenthal saying that's why we're asking you about the subsidiary issues that silly ask someone about a calm you know bob was in there your book yeah that's silly by tom now we wanna see if you're lying area not why i would you take a good dinner here dances committed as you that we're not often who listened to that if she thought these your book statements were called horrible hurtful and simply untrue and quote because we're not out alone i clearly implied some post of sexual conquests and that's the reason that you apologize to our correct file that's false speaking to us about that the yearbook and she she said she and i never had a social interactions your question the question is also have the i'll address suddenly only statement for answer your question is this a false promise and religious great harm to her and water pour in the soft drink like to record are upright and bring in our name up here is a lot of deposit in his opening statement he said we dallas and we really liked her she was a good friend and so we were paying tribute in and doing in elmira shooter her and that's why we did this now yes it's very weird to bail mileage to a good friend from high school and they were unaware of how how good a friend they were of yours said that you actually memorialize them and no one else in your yearbook medimmune keeper of your matias up your margie you know the robot indeed but why would you say illegal i wanted to celebrate you but i didn't want to know about it and so he gets super defensive about it and you know blumenthal frankly this is one of those things that make a ballpark dawn they all could've said would you would do things we're doing the f. b. i. investigation and would you want the renata ailments or switch back and forth in just make him an answer the question instead of blatantly lie by the could harm for fighting for your name up here is really unfortunate well calling someone anno one s. in that way they want aren't we aren't lying about by a number of your football friends at the time as boasting of sexual caught affected that's the reason i bring it out cannot fully also during play lynette look we're bringing up right now about her weight or the riots that don't interrupt our lay off attractive for a lifetime all there now blumenthal 'cause second you to explain to me the discrepancy between what you're saying now with your lawyer said in terms of of it being just about you guys shared a kiss and so you were talking about that made this they should have hammered this but he can't get away ways say how can you bring this up about her well did just tell the truth i'm so update jeff waco was speaking he wanted to delay the floor vote for week for investigation limited to one week flake wants to advance to the vote grassley calls to advance first and the ayes have it so that mean that the voters actually taking place in the committee brandon brandon them in the devoted taking place in the committee so he was confirmed by the committee would javelin flagrant so he said i would like to wait for this bad vote for a week now okay so the bottom out of committee but they walk one week it's time for the fbi investigation to go to the full senate floor it's okay so this suggests i'm a bet that concept that i was talking about earlier is calm they are very worried that particularly this week if they vote in the next day that three days later there to get information that can be problematic to cavanagh hand cuts can do will say what do you think it can it be if not lying under oath would like to get to be woody me that what what is what's gonna come out i think he if someone like school we or if i'm sorry i don't think as they all kinds of iliad johnny nodded at it really is that a teddy bear us out in the queen steps forward and says they knew each other they definitely knew each other i introduced them they knew each other then i think judge cavanaugh us get real problem the a. f. the f. b. i. does investigate and finds out that and sits down mark judge how long is gonna take mark judge default or like did you work exactly but while yeah i did did you remember seeing her there no i never start to say wait wait a second so she said she saw you at the same play me mark judge could then what do you not that they begin as much as you know her did you know her body yes you say you did know or how idea how often do getting out well i'm a i mean who knows calm to rededicate started scent dog the bounty hunter to delaware i mean there is a risk we and then there's a mom you know the woman who who first said like popeye a i don't remember that party but i believe tom ford lousy who are for a bloody four brothers said was ill she could decide like you know why i'm in it that i'm in a towel or the more i mean there's a lot of people already coming out from yale are saying they could that be the part you know in all this point to take a psych yet you like to be here like a lot of other stuff that
