presage awful return to capitol hill on tuesday for state of the union address is expected to talk about infrastructure souls immigration is the economy in the republican tax law of else passed in december was addressed to the nation comes at a time when his approval ratings are historically low compared to those of his republican in democratic predecessors many female democratic lawmakers plan to wear black to the president's address in solidarity with the movements protesting sexual harassment in misconduct on the docket signals that the whole thing in protest the presence for restore marks about him or french or haiti in africa nations jake is the president going to have a bipartisan tone in his address a database in your reporting probably not sit on but i think we will see is will see the beginning of the effort to sell the tax law which is republicans a kind of pushed all the chips in the middle on for this midterm election that the tax law that they passed people want more money in their pocket and all feel like they should be voting for republicans in that november i think that that this was skepticism the top republican fight scenes of this work but they do say present from needs to be out there talking about businesses and individuals keeping more money creating more jobs and nothing else they don't want him talking about other things you're off on tangents get on the trail getting from a chair was talk about the murder not a big project in infrastructure twenty eighty they didn't want people by sources and for yours first to tell you on the hill that's not probably not possible that the present what spencer with a trillion dollars got up on infrastructure i don't think he's done a fine much whoppers for democrats or republicans are like the nasdaq hitting and addresses alice began with that line about aliens a gentleman the state of our lord is and i guarantee you that the back by walking along by confines of superlatives i think this is going to be down for us our along an interactive a moment to really claim that he has made a lot of progress that has brought up in the country to interpret twice what we have seen and sign topless it isn't don't fall on the teleprompter can do that question is whether our farm forty eight hours later on twenty or can maintain that message to supply i think is you try to make this case it is used in making that i hear in their last few months which is that the stock market going out looking for long k. this helps everyone in the country any sooner try to make that case that that even people maybe you didn't see the business benefits of the past that presided say this way on that they're gonna benefit from a certain economy and an assertion optimism and businesses investing in new jobs and things like that and i'm sure also discovery of immigration would be surprised if in the gallery and as he did when he just congress year ago by he brings us some some people who may be their loved ones who were killed by people around the country illegally or something like that to try to make the security case for his immigration push the things certainly that's on the administration's been dealing in a variety of methods of the past few weeks trying to make the case the american people that on there is either end terrorism links you immigration on which in some researchers concluded that the a. really a new confounds amore that there is a jobs links immigration service i'm sure it's likely to be a big part of the speech one quick point he does have a good message for the stock market right leave the stockmarket is breaking records peoples for what he's probably if they have than not every american has a four one get your upcoming thirty is a message you if craft of writing kept within but the general discipline maybe it's it's a good message for all of us either digging and so the brazil tout his accomplishments of the democrats are really of writing for owen the midterm election karen what they think they do have a possible ways however if they certainly did our hands at our personnel and at this point what they need are a few things breaking we're waiting to come up with some good candidates have been at senor to voters and these districts where they've got in particular republican incumbents were sitting in sing sing districts that were won by hillary clinton serling democrats think they're dead guy fiends opportunity to hear their congressman joe kennedy the third of massachusetts will be given a democratic response yet younger generation of democrats are trying to highlight families exactly i think they want and they want the world cinema not every democrat of willard is seventy years old or older to let these these these spots that as much chance to be the person of response to the state of the union hasn't always worked out so well for for people who have given it sell the soviet big moment for it then x. generation kennedy's i think for my reporting democrats are incredibly bullish about taking back the house can feel like they look at these generic ballot numbers were people say their preference between democrats and republicans to keep sticking up for twelve points and twelfth which means you take back and according to them something like thirty five to forty seats so they wanted to know for the sport democrats and they have that don't wanna tie themselves a truckload of the incentive to cooperate with the president especially coming up to a midterm election with a bigger really good shape
