change about the war we won't be when you grow up the future is ours to win together we can't just then still is robert kennedy told us the future is not they get it on achievement sustaining the american dream has never been about standing pat reservoir each generation to sacrifice and strong and meet the demands of a new age in mozart's are we know what it takes to compete for the jobs and industries of our time we got in a way out educate and how will the rest of the world how the ultimate america that's why start of us we need to make worst possible in part deficit and reforms are rare moment that's how our people will prosper that's how wall when the future how did i want to talk about how we get there first step in when the future is encouraging american innovation the most important was certainly what the next big industry would beat were the new jobs will come when you're years ago we going over something called the interim that would lead to an economic revolution we can do that or america knows better than anyone else is spark for creativity imagination of working for the measurement for cars and drive were using computers and office the nation of less than the wright brothers will go on facebook in america innovation that doesn't just change our lives as how we make our living how our career prices him is what drives image because it's not always probable for companies to invest in basic research for our history our government has provided cutting edge science is none banners with the support the big before planted the seeds for the one that is what helped make possible things like computer chips in g. p. s. just think of all the good jobs for manufacturing to retail that calm romney's breakthrough he half a century ago when the soviet us in this place would want to someone called spot we have no idea how we would beat them to move the science was mayor marion nestle been exist raptor investing in battery research and education when just surpassed the soviets we unleashed a wave of animation the cradle industries and millions of new jobs this is our generation's but mo two years ago i said that we needed to reach the level of research and about what we haven't seen since the height of the space race in a few weeks i will be sending a budget to congress that helps us meet that goal one left in biomedical research information technology and especially clean energy technology how themselves head hair will strengthen our search jordi protect our plan and three countless new jobs for the already were saying the promos were nowhere to run would carry out our brothers who won the small measure referring come back to september eleventh grade moment you're the best refers to help apparent that but half of their factory weapon used in recession them are today with the help and on wall that empty space is being used to manufacture so sore shingles are being sold all across the carpet and robert words we reinvent ourselves that's what americans have gone for over two hundred years reinvented ourselves in the store on more success stories like brown brothers we've begun to reinvent or energy balls or not the santa monica where shortage out with telemedicine tissue engineers that if they assemble teams of the best minds in the fields and focus on the hardest problems in queen an what one of the apollo project so marked the california institute of technology heard about the way the charts on whitewater and fuel for cars at oak ridge national laboratory for using supercomputers to get a lot more power more nuclear facility with more research annan said as we can break our dependence on quarrel with bio fumes become a horse country that have a million what for vehicles on the road like forty fifty how we need to get behind this innovation and to help pay for it i'm asking congress to eliminate the billions of taxpayer dollars we correlate it all helps how nor bob of the donors but they're going just fine amaro so instead of subsidizing yesterday is that what invest in tomorrow's of clean energy breakthroughs know all we translate into clean energy jobs and businesses know there will be a market what purcell so to my kaelin you joining in selling a noble by twenty thirty five eighty percent of americans like for us we will calm for clean energy source how some votes one way to solve others want no clear we call the natural gas to meet his goal we will leave it at all when i first democrats republicans work together to make it at how maintaining our leadership and research and technology is crucial moment of success room for a while when the future if we want innovation to produce jobs in america and not over six we also have to win a race to educate our kids think about for the next ten years nearly half of all new job for our education goes beyond high school education and yet as many of the cornerstones party i'm finishing high school the color man of science education lags behind many other nations america's fallen tonight in the proportion of young people with a college degree so the question is whether all the citizens and as parents are going to do what's necessary to get every child a chance to succeed that responsibility begins not in our classrooms but in our homes and commuters family the first instills global warming in a trial only parents can make sure that you used for more than what it's about we need to teach our kids that is not just one of the super bowl who deserves to be sold right but where the science fair how we teach them of success is not a function of fame or p. r. report were invisible or schools share this was possible for a job loss in a classroom it should be a place of high expectations and high performance but too many schools normally this test but one set of pouring money into a system that's not what we lost the competition called waste dumps i thought that the states who said the peugeot was the most innovative plans to improve teacher quality of stone achievement will show you my race of the top is the most meaningful reform of our public schools in a generation for less than one percent of what we spend on education each year because lead over forty states to raise the standards for teaching them are in these bands were developed by the way not not by washington by republican and democratic governors drop of a race to the top should be the approach we fall this year as we were placed an old show what libel law but more flexible and focus on what's best for kids how to say we know what's possible for marchal what our former new just a top domenech workable teachers and principals school wards in communities the school wipers ran off and then three years ago he was rated world war schools in colorado walk in on her between two rival gangs the last may ninety seven percent of seniors was either couple most will be the first in their families to go talk that the first year of the school's transformation the principal who made it cost wiped away tears was doomed said thank you ms waters for showing that we are smart and we can make a house had hoped heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh of sauce or whoever left her parents the biggest impact on trial success comes from a man or woman of rock the question of south korea teachers are known as nation build your america it's time we treated the people educate our children with the same level of respect how will our war good teachers and stop making excuses for that house over the next ten years with so many baby boomers' retiring from our classrooms we want a fair hundred thousand new teachers in the fields of science and technology in engineering and may have that every young person listening to my dues complaining their career chores if you wanna make a difference of life of our nation to war make a difference i'm a wife and child become a teacher your country needs you how course the education race doesn't end with a high school diploma to compete higher education must be within reach of every mer that's why i have why we've added lian wanted sex parasites and the whites of banks and use the savings to make college affordable for millions of students how this year i asked congress to grow apart and make permanent part to wish and tax credit worked i'm bob dollars for four years of college heh heh heh heh heh heh heh because people may be able to train for new jobs and careers in today's best changing economy were also revitalizing america's community college blessed mother saw the promise of the schools of forsyth tech in north carolina many muslims there used to work in the surrounding that there's a sense what to one mother to a woman named captain rock and worked him for drugs researcher was eighteen years old and she told me she's earning her degree in biotechnology not at thirty five years old not just because for two jobs are gone but because she wants to inspire her children to pursue their dreams to this episode i hope that tells them to never give up we take these steps if we raise expectations for every child and give them the best possible chance and education from the baby are born into west java expect we will reach the goal the lives of two years ago by the end of the decade america wanted them at the heart of course are college graduates in the world how one less what about education to bed at hundreds of thousands of students excelling in our schools or not americans is some of the children of undocumented workers we had nothing to do with the actions of the parents they grew up as a manner as a pledge allegiance to our choir him yet they live every day what for the portage others come here from abroad to study in our colleges universities resume a train of advanced degrees we send 'em back home to compete against us makes no sense though i strongly believe that we should take on what some for all the issue of illegal umbrage but their work with republicans and democrats to protect our borders enforce our laws of the press the millions binocular workers were now living in the shadows how i know that it will be difficult vinyl will take time but tonight let's agree to make that up and let's stop expelling talented responsible young people who put these back in our research labs are starting a new business for over a reaching the smudge have a step in winning the future is we believe him or to attract new business is for shores we need the fastest most while ways to move people with an information from high speed rail the high speed and how our infrastructure used to be the best of our leaders went south korean alms not greater maddox is that we knew countries in europe and russia and left more than the roads railways and we knew china's building after trying to nor airports meanwhile on our own engineers break in our nation's infrastructure they gave us a deep we have to do about america's mission the beloved friends got no railroad right electricity rural communities constructed the interstate highway system the jobs created by these products and as tom firm blamed on fracture pavement became from business of the opening or towns new train station or the new offer so last two years we've begun rebuilding from forty percent for a project that is meant thousands of good jobs for the hard hit construction ministry pantomime of posing that we we don't whoa that's how will put more americans to work repairing crumbling roads and bridges will make short this is going great and attract private investment and pet projects they see what's best for the economy mahal tissues within twenty five years our goal is to get eighty percent of americans access to high speed rail how this can all while you go places and half the time it takes to travel by car for some threats will be best for them why about that now at least they grow into california midwest berardi on what within the next five years will make it possible for businesses to before the next generation flies the wireless coverage to ninety eight percent of all we're in this isn't just about has written about best remember your drop calls it's about connecting every part of america to the village smell world community and i'll around them were farmers and small business owners will be able sell their products all over the world to the firefighter birnbaum all the design of a burning building on to handle the what's the students eyeglasses with a good job sites for patients who could have face-to-face video chats with about all these invest in innovation dictation and infrastructure will make america a better place to do business and create jobs but to help our companies compete we also have to knock down barriers that stan i'm away their success with them for the years scrape away the lobbyists as a way that that's who the benefit particular company is an innocent muslim council orders to work the system can end up paying no taxes all progress or that one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world makes no sense unless judge how often i am asking democrats and republicans to simplify this is their will post well but when you're in you the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in twenty five years without heading toward us how how dealt with mrs sell more products abroad we saw it all doubling our exports by twenty four to become the more we export more jobs we create creator of all already our exports are up recently signed agreements with the i. in china that will support more than two hundred fifty thousand jobs for the united states unless what reply was a trade agreement with south korea that will support at least seventy thousand murdered jobs this agreement on president of support for business and labor democrats and republicans but i have this congress to pass it as soon as possible how before i took office i made it clear that we would enforce our trade winds and i were only side deals with the bait of american workers and for mope american jobs as well we did with free love what i intended it was we pursue agreements with panama and columbia and continue or asia pacific rim or trade talks how to reduce barriers to grope and best of ordered a review of government record when we find world report and unnecessary burden on business as we won't next month how well will not hesitate to create more force common sense safeguards to protect the american people how that when i'm in this country for more than a century why or who saved each water safe to bring her or is it read is why we asked the woman's child labor laws while after we put in place consumer protections against in fees and penalties by credit card companies in only to have another financial crisis that's why we asked for for the body prevents the health insurance industry permits boarding patients how that now and our worse than a few of you still wet concerns about our health care or what someone in the first to say anything can be improved if you have ideas about how to improve this law by making cure better or more for i'm eager work with you we'll start right now by correcting a flawed legislation has placed them on us or bookkeeping burn on small business how one on well into the one not going to do is go back to the players were insurance companies could buy some coverage because of preexisting condition how long will you tell james fallows brain cancer patient from texas this treatment might not recover malloy and seldom out a small businessman for more yet to go back to paying five thousand dollars more to cover his employees as we speak this law is making prescription drugs cheaper for singers and giving them in shorts dooms the chances are they on the patient parents got housewife this chamber tonight instead of reviving the battles last two years but that's what needs fixing and let's move forward how bout a final protocols that in winning the future used to make sure we are parade on her mom and dad we're living legacy of that suspending the began almost a decade ago and wake of the financial crisis some of that was no sir if you credit for save jobs and put money in people's pockets now the worst recession as though we have to come from the fact that our government spends more than sex and that is not sustainable every day family sacrifice to live with the mermaids bugs or government the dozens and how so to my i'm proposing that started this year we worry is that your domestic spending for the next five years how this would reduce the deficit by more than four hundred billion dollars over the next decade when discretionary spending the law was share our common sense dwight eisenhower was that the story is more choir painful cuts already we rose miss hours of hard working federal employees for the next two years a proposed cuts to things like you're deeply about my community action we're sector defense is also agreed to cut tens of billions of dollars in spending but he isn't in his generals we've our military can do about how i recognized islam in this chamber or you propose we perhaps animal insulin make whatever we can honestly afford to do without let's make sure that we're not doing it on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens how must make sure that what we're coming as well in excess white been adopted by getting our investments in animation and education is like lightning and order or their plan by removing attention the men make you feel like you're why am i at first but it won't take long for refill them but most of the gods in savings our proposal we address annual domestic spend which represents a little more than twelve percent for bush to make further progress we have to stop attending that coming this guy was running along will be enough to want how bipartisan fiscal permission i'd quit lester make this bristol court a moment we would all the proposals that they made important progress in their conclusion is that the only way attack or deficit is to cause excessive spending wherever we find in domestic spending defense spending health care spending and spending to tax breaks and loopholes how this means for reducing health care costs including programs like medicare and medicaid which of the single biggest contributors were long term that is the health insurance law we passed last year will slowly rising costs which is boring the reason that nonpartisan it promises of the peeling back off your wallet and a former petroleum dollars toward deficit so i'm going to look at other ideas to bring down costs including one that robinson doesn't last year medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits how what is on solid ground we should also find a bipartisan solution to strike the social security for future generations how we must do it without putting at risk for retirees most vulnerable people with isabel and without slashing benefits for future generations without subjecting americans guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock market how have we truly care about that as we simply can't afford a permanent extension of the tax cut will just two percent of americans how far we've said molly away from our schools to scholarship to wait for more stones which are best millionaires to give up their tax for islam our polishing their success it's about promoting american success had what nothing we could do want sex is for all our gift to simplify the individual tax bro how to top job what members of both parties are expressed an interest in doing this vampire hunter george how to know the time that now the time for both sides and both thousand cops democrats and republicans forgery principled compromise to get the job if we make the hard choices now to rein him about as we can make the investments we need to win the future when it's in one step further we sure to give our people the government gets more for the region that i'm a government it's more component the more fish weekend where the future when they got 'em up all hope that we live in new business in the information may of last major reorganization of the government happened in the age of white white t. v. there are twelve different agencies that you would accept her least

boat and we will push to get it at how the muddling your also work to rebuild people's faith in the institution of rubber because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax dollars are being spent you'll be able to lord website and get that information very first time in his book because you deserve to know when you're elected officials are meeting lobbyist i asked congress to do with white house has already gone bad information on water because the american people deserve to know that special interests aren't warning of legislation pet projects or partisan connor should know that

determined enemy is wherever they are to build coalitions that cut across a wide region and raise their religion in america's moral exam was always shine for all we are freedom and justice and it becomes we become as one tonight we can say that american leadership has been one of the markets then it has been was born books or rock were nearly one hundred thousand of our brave men and women
