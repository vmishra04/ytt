researchers have discovered the most similar planted yet to birth fourteen hundred light years away capper for fifty to b u orbits its star in three hundred eighty five days just twenty days longer their own year it stars just four percent larger billion and a half years older than twenty percent brighter than the solemn mean four feet to be is firmly in to goldilocks habitable zone that puts the odds of it being rocky like earth between fifteen and sixty two percent scientists jeff crawford says quote is the first possibly rocky habitable planet around to sort of start all living previously discovered exults minutes of similar size and we're big circle smaller cooler stars the planet was found by the cab for telescope which searches for possible earthquake twins by observing periodic dixon the brightness of stores this planet's pass before them with the way our moon cause an eclipse here on earth the coupler telescope stared at a single patch of the milky way for four years before it's pointing system failed to doesn't hurt to the mission still succeeded in cataloguing within forty six hundred exel play the candidates this means astronomer still have huge amounts of data sort through and the new findings like this discovery with four fifty to be just over one thousand of the eggs so plainly candidates have now been confirmed twenty years ago this fall the first exit planet orbiting a distant star was discovered in with his successor to captain watching twenty seventeen the pace of discoveries about to increase substantially the trains in we had so plaintive survey satellite or tax be able to cover hundreds of times as much sky is the kepler mission and would defy prime targets for further examination by the successor to hobble james webb space telescope set for october two thousand eighteen court astronomers can know project with some degree of confidence that of the six hundred stars within thirty light-years of earth there should be roughly sixty potential birth twins so according to doctor d. quinones the main who co discovered that first earthquake twenty twenty years ago if we keep working so well and so enthusiastically the issue of life on another planet will be salt lake ensure this video to help others on our little rock become aware of this good news for the u. editor burnt like us brother bryce thanks for watching
