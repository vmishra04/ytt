litigation does he believe now that is reporting from tuesday night gives him on what i had out here martha like he was on the hope that he's known all along that accusations what is that a huge hoaxes think we like to refer to it you're the white house was the greatest political witch hunts of all time i think this error greens i think there was any one that was cool wounding with the russians to influence the election look no farther than cleanse look no further than indian c. this is hypocrisy at its highest level that it baby and do well in american politics everything that the clinton campaign and indian saying were falsely accusing this president of doing over the past year they were actually doing themselves it turns out i think that this is our major scandal for the democrats located one matter has to do with the russian dolls the river into the air at the other matters the reunion deal firma de years ago and that he was asked about this yesterday i'm from the south wall he said as bad as watergate how you this year reunion deal as barren if not worse than phil harris is largely kind we're at that that had been working with a foreign government taking and millions of dollars for the clintons foundation and i had been giving over in such a large percentage of that uranium while she was secretary of state versus a lot things that need to be looked at here i've been a thorough about ravine isa take place ins and the way above my pay grade i think that there are deaf whale was causes for concern and i'm glad that some folks in any are filing talking about the wheel collusion with russia and that is with the clanking of pain and with the d. n. c. on both of these matters c. have confidence in bom all are those of who don't tie had won think he has confidence that they're gonna close this out soon i had mrs further evidence of why that should take quite know what one hears a close up soon i think we are seeing more more evidence i get shells what they've been working on us and investigating as for while until you're through various committees every day we find out more and more details about why the president has been right all along and why the democrats in the wrong all along and think that each day we're getting closer and closer i take closing away upon us on our fried and i have sadly for the democrats and it's only expanding from that voting is that based on news reports or is that they use on something else is some of the children the white house and he is based on fact i guess that that there has been and i know wrongdoing by the trial campaign and i'll want were pouring that we're seeing coming out that day in day out on so no one zero years and i used that is to be clear that no one from a form of justice who told you remember white house that it should be wrapping up simmons would be clear on that and i've spoken with anybody at the department of justice on african i'd think we're seeing that it is getting closer arrives in conclusion oklahoma talk now about that though that may happen and forty minutes is a big deal you talk about tax reform to jack's got to generation reform or whatever congress gives you were the brazil will agree with that vote expected on the budget comes up in twenty minutes so as we wait on this this week with regards to maneuver kids will be no change you for one jerry has always been agreed upon the middle class tax break that works and it stays okay that was remark to work for the third and then on camera yesterday the president was asked about again it and said that's two you fear that has laid you've adhesive this morning did we ought to do found at is that they would use and the judge gave one of the thigh for our first i have a man from feels you don't want to judge of what four or five days it at and i think give ray is they've as a fabulous out for four or five days the czar's the i need to negotiate publicly and behind closed doors and and you would secure am what what is the present position on the floor all for one case negotiable we're gonna start to what the president is committed to protecting people's futures in doing that by protecting their retirement that is a president who really wants to make this tax plan and the tax cuts very focused on and the middle class and by doing that we need to make sure we're protecting their future protecting our charming accounts and at some in this present committed to give them but again the question is one of the four were gay porn changes does it or not sir what can i can negotiate those deals with right now right here the president is getting applewhite can set you know is the president is one hundred percent committed to making sure that we're protecting people for charm is to take killing doesn't allow class and making sure that their futures are preserved for the informer so it might change their tutsi this is not set in concrete that's what i'm hearing for all of looking at how acting and negotiation physicians are here or even from the podium i hate any point on the tax plan and have no way out the principles of where the president is what he wants to see happen i'm worried continue working with congress to make sure who traded debate is an assist or a tax cut that we've seen a long time no other controversial provision is the state and local tax deduction colonel there are three states the tree california new york and new jersey that twenty eight republican members of the house what's the chance you get that idea through with the potential for twenty eight no votes of the what we think that we're in a bad move this story or demanded the ball down the field to start only acting one other thing so what gatwick cons estate local tax deduction is very few people actually i am eyes and be good for our around twenty percent of people actually i'm as those things will be offset by other tax credits that are part of this plan every cop in the name for that we're in it and karen i'll pull pushy on that because of they go to similar answer but in summation does the white house believe they can get this congress to move in two thousand seventy two sons wayne taylor and i think that we have to look americans are demanding that we do something and we did something vague involved in this present is leading that effort and he's gonna push story i make sure that we get the vegas was historic tax cuts that we saying to take away for the middle class i in decades appreciate your time today thanks for coming back here thing that makes allegorical hmm on
