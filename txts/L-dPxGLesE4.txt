and you can last ten years i've been spending my time trying to figure out how why human beings assemble themselves into social networks that kind of social network i'm talking about is not the recent online variety but rather the kind of social networks of human beings have been assembling for hundreds of thousands of years ever since we emerge from the african savannah so why form friendships and coworker and sibling and relative relationships with other people who in turn have similar relationships with other people in this spreads on out endlessly into a distance and you get a network that looks like this every got is a person every line between them is relationship between two people different kinds of relationships you can get this kind of vast fabric of humanity in which we're all in bed at my colleague james fall or not i had been starving for quite some time but the mathematical social biological and psychological rules that govern how these networks are assembled at one of the film or rules that govern how they operate how they affect our lives but recently we've been wondering whether it might be possible to take advantage of this insight actually find ways to improve the world to do something better actually you fix things not just understand things so what the first things we thought we would tackle would be how we go about predicting epidemics democrats in the art in predicting an epidemic is through the cdc you're some other national body is to sit in the middle were you are and collect data from physicians in laboratories in the field that report the prevalence of the incidence of certain conditions so so and so patients have been diagnosed with something or other patients him diagnosed in all these men are fed into a sample repository was on the line if everything goes smoothly one to two weeks from now you'll know where the epidemic was today actually letting your soul go there wasn't the sort of promulgated of this notion of cool flute friends with respect to the flu where we buy look at people searching behavior today we could know where the flu what the status of the epidemic was today with the prevalence of the above the epidemic today but what i'd like to show you today is a means by which we might get not just or rapid warning about an epidemic but also actually early detection of an epidemic in fact this idea to be used not just to predict epidemics of germs but also to protect epidemics of all sorts of collins for example anything that spreads by a form of social contagion could be understood in this way from abstract ideas on the left like patriotism or i'll truism or religion to law practice is like driving behavior book purchasing or drinking or bicycle helmet other safety practices or products that people might by purchase of electronic goods anything in which there is kind of interpersonal spread outside of the diffusion of innovation could be understood and protected by the mechanism i'm gonna show you now so as all of you probably know the classic way of thinking about this is the fusion of innovation or the adoption car so here on the wyeth says with a percent of the people that are affected enemy x. axis we have time at the very beginning not too many people are affected and get this classic said more nor can shape car and the reason for this shape is at the very beginning was to one or two people are the infected or affected by the thing and then they affect our infect to people who in turn effect forty eight sixteen and so forth and that the academic world are phase of the car and eventually you saturate the population there fjord fewer people were still available that you might in fact and then you get the plateau that kurt you get this classic sit mortal curve and it holds for germs ideas product adoption behaviors and the like but things don't just diffusing human populations at random they actually diffused through networks because as i said we live our lives in networks and these networks have a particular kind of a structure of you look at an outward like this is a hundred five people and the lines represent the doctor the people i'm alive for present friendship relationships you might see that people occupy different locations within the network in a different kind of relation to subpoena people eat that friendship relationships sibling relationships was also relationships coworker relationships on neighbor relationships and the like and different sorts of things spread across different sorts of times for instance actually transmitted diseases will spread across actual cause our corporations people smoking behavior might be influenced by their friends or they're optimistic or their church charitable giving behavior might be influenced by their coworkers or by their neighbors but not all positions in the network are the same so few look at this you might be really grasp that different people have different numbers of connections some people have one connection some have to some have said some have ten connections in this is called the degree of unknown with a number of connection seven note have been in addition or something else to fuel that note am be able to fix connection like if you can see this image from apartheid you you can appreciate that there's something very different between know today in the so let me ask you this i can cultivate this intuition by asking a question who would you rather be with a deadly germ was spreading to the network a. r. p. b. it's obvious he is located on the edge of the network now who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip were spreading to the network a and you have any needed appreciation that pays to be more likely to get this thing that's reading and to get it sooner by cartel there's proffer location within the network a. in fact is more central and this can be formalized mathematically so if we wanted to try something that was reading through a network will be ideally would like to do was to set up sensors on the central individuals within the networks including note any monitor those people that are right there in the middle of the network and somehow get an early detection of whatever is that is spreading to the network so if you saw them contracted term or a piece of information you would know that soon enough everybody was about to contract this term for this piece of information and this would be much better than monitoring six randomly chosen people without reference to the structure of the population in fact if you could do that what you would see us something like this on the left in pale again we have yet to carve adoption in the dotted rat line we shall what the adoption would be in the random people in the last in line shifted to the left we shall with the adoption would be in the central individuals within the network on the wyeth says is the king live incidents of contagion and on the x. axis is the time another right inside the show the same day that but you would daily incidents that will be shown here is like you're very few people are affected more more more up if you're years the peak of the epidemic which shifted to the left us what's occurring in the central individuals and his difference in time between the two he is the early detection the early warning we can get about the pending epidemic in the human population problem however is that mapping human social networks is not always possible it can be expensive not feasible that unethical or just frankly just not possible to do such a thing sakata we figure out what the central people are in that work without actually mapping the network to hear what we came up with was an idea to exploit a very old factor known fact about social networks which goes like this do you know that your friends have more friends than you do your friends have more friends than you do this is known as the friendship paradox imagine a very popular person in the social network like a party host with hundreds of friends enemies and throw was just one friend and you pick someone at random from the population they were much more likely to know the party house if they nominate the party wasn't there friend that party host as a hundred friends therefore has more friends than they do in this in essence is what's known as the friendship paradox the friends of randomly chosen people have higher degree and are more central then the random people themselves in you can get into one of appreciation for this if you imagine just the people at the perimeter of the network if you take this person the only friend they have to nominate his best person or by construction must at least two and glee more friends and i happen to every peripheral note and in fact it happened throughout the network is to move and everyone knew that when they nominate the reign of one random person nominees a friend of theirs you moved closer to the center of the network so we thought we would exploit this idea in order to study whether we could it take phenomenal within that works because now this idea we give it take a random sample of people have them nominate their friends those friends would be more central and we could do this without having to map the network and we tested this idea with an outbreak of h. one and one flew at harvard college died in the fall and winter two thousand not just the few months ago we took thirteen hundred randomly selected undergraduates we had them nominate their friends and we followed all the random students and their friends daily in time to see whether or not they had the flu epidemic and leave this passively by looking at whether or not they got the university health services and also we have been e-mail was a couple of times a week exactly what the we predicted happened so are the random group is in the red line over here the epidemic in the french will be shifted to the left over here and the difference in the two was sixteen days by monitoring of friends who we could get sixteen days advance warning of impending epidemic in this human population now in addition to that if you were an analyst who was trying to do just by the end epidemic or to protect the adoption of a product for example which you could do was to get the random sample of the population also have them nominate their friends and follow the friends and follow both the random scan the friends among the friends the first evidence you saw public above zero in adoption of the innovation for example would be evidence of an impending epidemic or you could see the first time the two cars to purge the show on the left when did the randomness one of the french take off and leave the random spend start out their car started shifting and that is indicated by the white line up for forty six days before the peak of the epidemic so this would be a technique for why we could get more than a month in half a warning about a flu epidemic in a particular population i should say that calm far advanced notice one might get about something depends on a host of factors that could depend on the nature of the pathogen different pathogens doing using this technique you get different warning or other phenomena that are spreading or frankly on the structure of the human network know what our case although it wasn't necessary we can also actually map the network of the students so this is a map of seven hundred fourteen students and their friendship sides in a minute now muppet this map into motion and a daily cuts to the network for a hundred and twenty days the red dots are gonna be cases of the flu and the yellow dots are gonna be friends of the people with the flu and the size of the doctors the proportional to people's about how many of their friends have the flu so bigger got to be more of your friends have the flu and if you look at this immature we are now in september the thirteenth this youtube faces light up to this you can evoke blooming of the flu in the middle you were on october the nineteen this will the epidemic or this approaching our november bang bang bang bang bang you to see lots of blooming in the middle and end of the nastiest are leveling off you were fewer cases towards the end of december and this type of of utilization can show that epidemics like this take root in effect central individuals first before they affect others now as i've been suggesting this method is not restricted to germs but actually to anything that spreads and populations information spreads in populations norms can spread and populations behaviors can spread of populations and by the papers like the meetings like criminal behavior or voting behavior or healthcare behavior like smoking or vaccination or product adoption or other kinds of behavior that relate to interpersonal influence if i'm likely to do something affect others around me this technique and get early warning or early detection about the adoption within the population the key thing is afford to work there has to be interpersonal influence it cannot be because of some broadcast mechanism affecting everyone uniformly now the sink to the same insights can also be exploited with respect to networks can also be exploited in other ways for example in the use of targeting specific people for intervention so for example most of your probably familiar with the notion of herd immunity so that the population of a thousand people and don't wanna make a population immune to a pathogen we don't have to immunize every single person if we immunize nine hundred and sixty of them itsy bitsy as if wade immunize a hundred of them because even if one or two of the non union people gets infected this no one for them to in fact they're surrounded by immunize people so ninety six percent is as good as a hundred percent or some other scientists have estimated what would happen if you took a thirty percent random sample of the thousand three hundred people in the eyes that which you get any population level immunity in the answer's no but if you took this thirty percent these three hundred people inhabit nominate their friends and to the same number of vaccine doses and vaccinated of friends of the the three hundred to three hundred friends you get the same level of her immunity as if you'd vaccinated ninety six percent the population animates greater efficiency with a six budget constraints and similar ideas can be used for instance to target by distribution of things like that that's in the developing world if we can understand the structure of networks and intelligence we could target to whom to audit the interventions to foster these kind of spread or frankly for advertising all kinds of products if we can understand how a target it could affect the efficiency you look what we're trying to achieve and in fact we can use dana from all kinds of sources nowadays this is a map of the eight million phone users in the european country every doctor person every line represents a volume of calls between the people and we can use that stated that the impassively obtained to map the whole countries and an understand who was located where within the network without actually having to queried about all we can get this kind of a structural insight and other sources of information as you know about where available about was such information from e-mail interactions online interaction social online social networks and so forth and in fact we are in the year of what i would call massive passive data collection efforts there all kinds of ways we can use massively collected data to create sensor networks to follow the population understand what's happening in the population intervene in the population for the better because these new technologies tell us not just who's talking to but where everyone is and what you're thinking based on what the rubble in on the internet and what they're buying based on their purchases at all this administrative unit can be pulled together and process to understand human behavior in a way we never could before so for example we could use proper is purchases of fuel the truckers are just going about their business and applying fuel and we see a blip up in the proper to purchase the fuel when all the recession is about to end or we can monitor the velocity blood which people are moving with earphones on a highway and see if the velocity the phone company can see is the velocity is to asap is showing down that there's a traffic jam and they can feed that information back to their subscribers but only to the subscribers on the same highway located behind a traffic jam or we can monitor doctors prescribing the papers passively and see how the diffusion of innovation the pharmaceuticals occurs within doctors or again we can monitor purchasing behavior and people and walk tell these types of phenomenon can diffuse within human population and are three ways i think that these massive passive it can be used what is fully passive like why does the guy just described for instance the proper example or we don't actually intervene in the population in any way that one is croissant active like the fluids out like they were we get some people to buy nominate their friends and then passively monitor the friends do they have the flu or not and then we can get warning one other example would be if your phone company you figure out who sent to linda champa the networking you asked those people look we just texas your fever every day just texas your temperature and mac and collect vast amount of information about people's temperature but from centrally located individuals and be able large scale to monitor an impending epidemic was very minimal input from people or it could be more fully activists on all sides was because lots of talk about today where people might globally participate in which these or photographing we're monitoring elections and op loading information away we can fool to understand social prophecies and social phenomena in fact the availability of the state i think heralds the kind of new here out over i'd like to hide others like to call computational social science is sort of like wood galileo invented that garden event came to use the telescope and could see this they haven't seen a new way we're live in hope became aware of that the microscope when she invented and could see biology anyway but now we have access to these kinds of day on that allow us to understand social prophecies and social phenomenon in an entirely new way that was never before possible and what this science we can understand how exactly the whole comes to be greater than the sum of its parts actually can use these insights to improve society and improve human well being thank you jack investment and cried and high-speed
