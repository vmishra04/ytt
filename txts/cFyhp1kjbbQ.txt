know mark zuckerberg subspace alone were some kittner dorm room comes up with good idea actually does that disaster all the way we get to the future that i'm talking about and is we need thousands of copies museum dynamism in space the we've seen on line over the last four years and we can do that we've reusable space vehicles so you're spanning the the billion dollars of your money every year yes sir well i would say yes to like the worst have you had no we're doing pretty well i'm not so very well you are the richest violent but why this was a top hat and something cold when you say well this invade the richest people said they your visions the verbs almost as though probably are but it's still the address that bigger issue both sure that they knew individuals were locked him out and no have worked hard on me and come up with innovative ideas like to soothe be able to take more than the giant balls of cuba and then the site a space rather than our the law both in seoul which you what

the size of the blue origin is where most and most important thing i'm working on iron but i will live to see them to see a whole rolled out the shoe want people to be doing things you want risk taking you want people to have vision that most people don't agree with that you're sure to society than a unique way of that vote all of the real new movers are driven by being right wing most of the war was wrong belt law you are my research here are with taxes the west texas yeah the hunter there was a plunger then they'll buy what ho walk a thin thoughtful about what lord jin is going with you about the first video all this is though what's that although i was able to witness was still slow but what's going on here when we get home from his work this is the both reason why what is this is a very important task because and we didn't have the last of the skating over in the privy council and his only goes wrong composed of society and different and i play him to make sure that what says so high altitude skiing one more testing of cases the mahila last of the one and he had and what's it look like siege i've heard that silvio his homeland stay on rockingham that have someone going to say you want to come down to earth yes you're his colleague on the tip of your finger and that was the reasons that we chose verbal landing of for architecture is the skills lupo just like with an inversion pendulum the at he's you're the bigger the pendulum gets pencil on the tip of your finger is such a very difficult to do what you need such high response time but as you get to broomstick recession pretty easy to bouts of broomstick on the your fingers of the bigger the vehicle gets the easier fertile land against the skills for nicely now when we saw the council lan what was shown in that video was what the council landed on a horned toad yes there are those remarkable he hopped away the l. yep that's like a very lucky toad the house so some throats of their best thing in the desert in the outcome will live to the castle up with the crane and there was a strode right there a now that spaceship the shoppers convict him humans into space and i'm not gonna be though for fossils but pay the cost of words those right it's a truism mission and what is on top of that i'm hopeful about what happened you know in twain nineteen i was hopeful what happened twenty eighteen so at a time to keep telling that to snow operates interrupt you know this is not want us to be the safest but he's vehicle docile bob there's no blue large employers are rumors about what happens in one or the state out of the space without anyone to mount only has made the sign is donna karan's top bounce around that's right though in their sixties we're all gonna be before paying astronauts and that we know the nope nope nope lauren to employ on one arm of the whole astronauts because these are born out of the day or two of training yeah i don't have dared to training a whole lot pushing for a day and i think you need to do is change the lives that maybe to do the training alone against people say once again there are only will be our chances you get above the carmelite which is a hundred clunkers above the surface of yours then you need to earn irrational wings that you know alan shepard was the first american to do that when i'm sober will air flight many many decades ago now and that's the that's the awful we're not making people and that and they say that scene within the and the earth's atmosphere and seeing her from our perspective really changes you recall that overview of fact when i'm in a series of short got mcnall has so often the review that's step one whose business it out and bought steptoe reasonable land we have a video that's a land without an listen see the iona of lions point one was right when it's about math science center at six twenty years ago when you're out he'll end and to its vital rattling and notice how or why one of my hat hat and them i had it in our news in most of us as to that and what hello and i asked what would your hands jay oh three point eight five million pounds of thrust to as a rule in her usual and resigned engine and someone wobbled let her in downtown at white's over the river which are usually has an absolute he'd gotten new york region is the audio and visual rose one has vision that it was only in is void embarrass us vernon's thunder and since when are the living shit malaysia has stabilized when underway was liver and the lives of it was written to him was that one go robbery and it's his state route one woman as says that in one second stage this first version the second stage of expendable so this is the work force out of the i'm for decades that imposes upon about two and half billion or development projects and words could be useful work all bushes you can imagine likely mom including the way our were the process of building lunar lander right now the wall where more than five metric tons of cargo on the serbs were by this carping government contract yet to the airport here to do the heavier forces are close friends for the song about the controversial area of some companies are cool pale has no prob high on the crisis was on for years decided not to go into that collar worker may even bought the what construct a period of us was if he were to jibe contractor so tell me what your philosophy of their wouldn't think about high tech companies using those bands private technology to do work with you that what we're intentions were to duty and i think we should and you know i that doesn't make any sense you sometimes was the jobs of the senior leadership team is to make them right decision you wanted some popular and fiftieth big tech companies are turn their back on u. s. department of finance this country is gonna be in trouble so now it's full highlighted his courage iraq crisis that this this country is given by new urbanism very conflicted about kurt halter discovers what this country is the job and that is amazing how still have to have your office the place for what calm there there are other countries worker brews trendy didn't let let 'em if we're to be ally come along alderman twelve foot when it what this is this is a great country and spent it does need to different are now you're not the only white space program is another one and we took want love to watch out there i know you wanted nothing to first choice what type lorna was the one worthy apollo get word to them there by the death outdoors another copy rumbling often than not going there that river's without air what's the relationship between low wharton and space axis of evil or yahoo older really isn't much religion into two companies the more competitors boeing dia de my view on this is this is a big industry it was true philosophy winners and if we're going to achieve for humanity that what i want to achieve this can be thousands of competes in just like what you see on it and i'm in so we need lots of successful companies helping out this fall towards sports is a bad analogy for business and so i encourage urban no longer booster rocket rumors and the church hapless and so on sports is very damaging metaphor for business viewfinder sports arena joins winner and loser been in business usually industries rise and fall and so this is not to say you can really can be multiple winners in there often are the number of bottle like winner take all the streets because your odds of winning a winner take all his shoes while he was a new one is you were there can be a number of workers calm also though we'd blow went to texas where you showed me something else for building they're not too for the cloth wants or the ten thousand your claw bomb which i've been falling for all want fireworks story about newsweek was twenty years ago ball and people mocking say nothing will never be built on you embrace the project you will come and go huh huh huh huh oh now why why not why why i'm beth is something less than ten thousand years ago can be around for space we have to do with him one of those with whom they set off base will be referred to the assertion that no nation status overlaps the souls issues you rise and fall is no but investors such along you're trying to wake of the temperature clark was ended by this one guy named in a palace one of you know of the burden is under way back in the nineteen eighties and no one had to wait for somebody to the creation of a bill that belied by the life i believe powerfully than symbols than they do change thinking of and the fact the simple fact of the matter is that we have become so hard for the species that we can no longer afford to think short term ends we do this there's never been we've never needed to think long term as a species that we finally do and so we need more symbols for long term thinking in our lives o'clock whole crop which nothing for few hundred years to wimbledon and then people will make fun of it for long time and then once it's old people do like this with our openings and so the lead how that's all we're old thing and though they will do is still the city in the white and middle whistling in the oaks and wants to think about the wanton future in which to do that soon it is that a very slow burn while the loneliness is something about burning now on the outer cannot praise from memorials the question about big cat calls that this out right now why are stored twenty five years ago we were super optimistic all about technology with their wings and happy birthday to change the world and you're from school commingle something up for free itself the center but now we're finding that this lot consequences are suffering and companies like yours or are getting worse for me to talk about how you look competition but some people feel this lock up out of them often nothing the deep and going to tell me how interviewing saw your viewing this difficult moment for technology was running one of the major most powerful companies are about the origin of that i was on top and negotiators on her wall and is first of all i really incredibly optimistic about technology the reason that we have no hold our souls of those of us just as species on earth where bootstraps is because we have continued to make technological progress and the and bottled and technology so whispered to side in other ways they can be misused the schools using this isn't new know the book was invented and people could rival evil books and then we bad revolutions with them in the end create fascist empires with books and so on and so on those in the book of bad so there is the end i i filled it society devotes an immune response eventually to that uses of new technology but it takes time i see that right now i think social media is increasing unfortunately identity politics tribalism in the internet this current creationism confirmation bias machine if you have a growing in one of you and you go to some searches you find confirmation a point of view and if your news feed and enjoying things and showing you things to confer reported you by and large and so that you have the technology that increases confirmation bias probably isn't good does that lead to more trouble isn't the end and so we are known as loses his project you know that it will figure them out and i'm worried that some use technologies will be very useful for autocratic regimes them to enforcer will open and we know that blush of things to happen then that we are delighted c'mon so we cannot turn on you but that's not new but always been the case and that we will figure it out will blessing that wanted to stop the progress of new technologies you when they are do we use you know what biotech is gonna be if that is gonna be amazing it's gonna save the children and his goons in the known cure cancer and many other things this could have dual use to an old that poll that is gonna happen and as far as the broader question about tech companies including hands-on i think all largest occasions should be scrutinized it makes sense to me i think in a government should be scrutinized government agencies use her husband nonprofit used it as large companies should be inspected and examined scrutinized them is normal what i know i've been amazon the whole time i i was there you know what it was just me and contends that and that you know it isn't grimes who is a grocer carlos rogers there was one but there are certain things or large companies can do it or not can build boeing seventy seven or brooch remarkable by phone or garage and so we want george company is what we do also want scrutinize them and that and that's as an egg creations ideas and so with this is going to happen is normal told take it personally bit it should happen you will live in a society where that happens and what would you do about it just make sure the chicken doctor's office such away the winner scrutinized you pass with flying colors lancelot it warehouse
