what is we have two different systems to put systems will on to the fathers of them we have decades of profound difference both bilaterally and intervention why have set to present as perot is that we are moving forward and not walking backwards that we don't view cuba's a threat to the united states i hope that my visit here indicates degree to which were setting a new chapter in cuban american relations good come what it is true with proper use around the world we're we have normalized relations we will continue to stand up for a basic principles that we believe america believes in tomatoes

is universal mom wanted wasn't s. role of them has pointed out that it is you're making sure that was going reduced vegetation or health care as basic secured an old age of those things are human rights is what i personally would not disagree with bob what it doesn't attract rom some of these other ones and the wall of the human rights dialogue is not realistic to get into cuba all they should govern themselves but to make sure that we're having a writer in opposition or opposition and walk with a week or more on the job done it does not mean that it has to be the only issue we taught economics both sides of us changes international cooperation on the issues of regional those walls walpole import or all homework but this is something that we are going to stay on our hands though i actually whoa brother castro commenting on some areas were you girls who were falling short because of the week we should not give you more afraid of criticism or discussion as well here's one thing i do not is that what doctor cuban americans jim your second generation and sort of vigorously though not for you to write what i already that i've talked to rob the united states when there's enormous whole that there could be reconciliation and which the president of the stars to be built between your bombardment and cubans view their family size and cultural sized rehearsals for all hands of that everyone would have problems size been re establish a wad of the impediments to strengthen most times is this is with us for rides lockers at some extent we can have a good cover so shy about that and to actually make progress that i've been will all loss to save it for while i love relationship that is possible in the absence of a live picture will continue to be very popular europe's none of this is not to be the most privileged swamp and her as you know i've got assertions were for grown up its while millions were some of our burke also lives as well as bumpers of the we don't have as possible is troops but i think it is something that that matters i've met with people who've been subject to arbitrate tension that something that i can live up to speak out because i hear from them like leonardo warnings about seven the bella what in bumble bee shady you i'm able to unlock the middle allowed in with the privileges you will you do all they but if you were are that person was averse to pop out of control when you're not had a vladislav a cop cars fire fire fire soon as your president biggest very low official would be about it i mean they still robe and low to c. c. i have a show for the baton blows to a crucial vote dave feelings being a resume this week was bought the gladiator located in the value that that is totally whoa put to good people but by race yo growth that but when the men on a big one and all the bottom of what a widower to the lobby voting for me is yet it was so for you to come to get together and the vatican foot yacht bob but the outback on an eclipse on president got blown up the smooth flow and move it up with him on those hallelujah ennoble public don't you go to the bone by the president didn't go up up this bailout lucian the budget of

moon unit in the middle of one would know what to do good women who go to pump up birds and when you say i repeated what did you you don't have to go on august eleventh year the door that what you're going to open it good to see really sad and the bug have but you know the world you'll come to see that obama's the probe will raise your opinion but the immortal rope rebuttal bought them at them will read it you gave him up and people who don't vote yet police who victory go on living will be read by fifi coming the enemy in the vehicle on and you don't hold two widow with a muslim vote will make him if he should be on the way you see him but if the she'll be opening lazy oh my god way i'm going to wake of a big night the only go around here in africa will they were once a year for you to soothe food doolittle want us to get in he suddenly the i'll get out what the government's you eli eli through would show that a woman but what i mean you're going up on a big deficit this year they all laughed and then to have i have a vote up got out director of no more so will the administrative work are you made a number of modifications on the more farmer for the 'em world among my opening state and we've actually been overly aggressive been exercising as much flexibility we can give them that the law would embark on players has not been repealed by cops there may be some technical aspects of the embargo but we can still make adjustments on them in on problems as there was so for example the issue rob our hands the need to make modifications in terms of all the wrong was implemented to encourage rather than the scourge of reforms that your government so much longer gai jin and to fuss over greater trade and commerce that is something that grew out of the dialogue between our governments and we have made appropriate adjustments to work you'll take some time for commercial banks to understand the new rules where certain that this is mary were we can improve current circumstances but i'll be honest with you that the list of things when you administrative where is warned what then bob all of changes that have to be made with respect to the embargo are not rely on congress making trips by the mercure bobby andrews air in getting mad dog before we regulate commerce is not as productive as i would like during the presidential election years why fact that we have such a large congressional delegation with democrats and republicans were those is an indication that there is growing interest in some drivers would remember as i just in the myra we're answer pop quickly that happens to a woman or depend on whether we can bridge some awkward but around human rights issues about what i'll order the console or it sends a signal that whispers engagement between the two covers on these matters for maya not promise of roosevelt said no more question cameron mitchell of n. b. c. interview the white and you read and you feel at intermediate today it may be our c. to accelerate gates and i think that you had me in ops and that the changes they even made these and that get each mark will be to a stop the years by that and like a bias in getting heat it back to back me the idea of having me that a new five that he had said again today mrs continue it's the issue which is blocking it and his family and he said the conversations that ride right hand and when will they even as you know arriving here we're mad as a peaceful protests ladies and why he would think that that's that then you have civilized like this the same time you have such found thinking of doing definitions of what i need to do that today they are having passed down from many of us it's remarkable that you use the tobacco is something that you test like to see a feature the president obama have nine months meaning you have state needs that began in nineteen eighteen point in future of light and she's given it different definitions that differing interpretations of the allegations like to mark the role of henry i am what where why i'm i get the entire range but i believe it will end and kept there were all will continue beyond my views which raises watch the reason is that while we did for fifty years does not serve our interests for the first attempted to as a war we made the announcement about normalization of legends if you get one or something will ever know for fifty years of of what it might make sense to try something new in bed that's what we've got and the fact that there has been strong support not just in so long was not just among them are people of all so long tube it indicates that this is a process that showed him will continue having said that lifting the embargo requires the votes of a majority in congress and maybe even when jordan so and as i indicated to present s. for two things i think will talk exile in the face of when the embargo to amend the forest is to the degree that we can take advantage of the existing changes that we've already and we see partners that will help to validate but for this traded calls saw for example we have said that there is no longer are the restriction on u. s. companies to invest him to helping to build the internet and blob man infrastructure in some of your views not is not against us while his in childhood by the administration if we start swinging those bells and whistles you're sticking points and cubans are benefiting from playwrights s. to vienna and one on a lot of worship of the devoid of deception or by understandable the meat sauce young cubans rory good friend of our vessel in using the internet that interested me start ups that builds a constituency for ending the embargo if we belong what we're going in the vault and you start seeing more u. s. farmers interaction with cuban problems and others more exports and imports battle to constituents and all the possible lemon they were wrong increases so so so that we take advantage of we want to go whoa whoa emma second area which one is just extensively as usual for cuba had it him what come about that incident you know you don't mind of yours disagreements with chinese were a human rights of the war in vietnam where this you have deep disagreements with a well know what we first visited him then people to big certain whether we should be traveling met because of longstanding human rights violations in our view and the approach that i've taken has been identified engage frankly clearly stating or believe so but also of being clear that we can't force change on the verge of a century old love with it has to come from within then that is gonna be a more useful strategy then to the same kinds of rigid disengagement of for fifty years did not i guess ultimately what those themselves regrets i haven't even people i think that if you make cubans here and cubans been americans and their meeting and talking and interacting in doing business together in one school with other learning from each other that will recognize people are the men in that context i believe that trade war had been taught not on the so those several of them for granted whatever you do that asia
