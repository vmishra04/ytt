all the war earn one half how many of you have you select rocks for chief like microsoft itself for a guy out how many of you have one of business with us for achieved by here like my dad did for small producers of philadelphia whole lot less well that's the way was gone for hundreds of years in early nineteen seventy eight my story working on an idea that eventually became the suckow and the next year it ship running on something new called an apple to personal computer you could tell that things have really changed when six years later the wall street journal ran an editorial that assumed you know this account was maybe even were using it steve jobs back in nineteen ninety said that spreadsheets propel the industry for this account propel the success of apple more than any other single that warmer persona of state said that the captain and run for some other computer who you'd be interviewing somebody else right now so this account was instrumental in getting personal computers one business desks howard calm about what was it what i'd go through to make it be one wants to help our first order program back in nineteen sixty six when i was fifteen just a couple months after this photo was taken few high scores have access to computers in those days like to lock up an awful lot of pop perseverance i was able to get computer time around the city after sleeping in the modern woodstock fell off to mit to go to college where to make mommy i've worked on the mall ticks project pommel dix was a trail blazing interactive time during system have you heard only makes it an unix offering systems they came from all decks are work one of them all decks versions of water known as introverted computer languages that are used by people not computer fields to dinner calculation for seated at a computer terminal after graduated from mit i went to work for digital equipment corporation that jack are you worked on software for the new where we are both computerized typeset i helped newspapers replaced there are other reporters typewriters with computer terminals are great software and i go out the field to places like the kansas city star where i would treat users and get feedback of this was real world experience is quite different award saw him alive in mit after that i was project leader of the software for decks first word processor began a new field like with typesetting the important thing was crafted a user interface that was both natural inefficient for non computer people to use after i was in fact i went to work for a small company that made microprocessor based on what try cash registers for the fast food industry wide i always wanted to store copy with my friend bob franken my man on the baltics project of the mighty sword decide to go back to school board as much as i could about business and in the fall of nineteen seventy seven i heard the nba per room at harvard business school i was one of the fuel percentages students who had a background in computer for raymond there's a picture of me from your books in the front row about harvard we learned by the case method we do about three cases of dengue cases consist all of a call to a few dozen pages describing a particular business situation they'll often have exhibits and exhibit's often have words and numbers laid out ways that makes sense for the particular situation for usually all somewhat different here's my homework began numbers were laid out ways to make sense lots of calculations we've got really close to or calculators in fact here's my calculator for halloween i would just opposite calculate beginning of each class the professor would want somebody to present the case what they would do is they would explain what was going on and then decade information that the professor which we ascribe want to the mini mall right blackboard to the form of the class and we have a discussion one of the really frustrating things when you got all your homework you common next day only to find out that you made an error and polio the numbers you did wrong and you couldn't participate as well and we were marked by class participation so sitting there with the g. seven other people might classify got to the dream or most programmers in those days worked on mainframes building things like inventory systems and pay roll systems and building systems but i have worked on interactive word processing him on demand herschel computation is that thinking about about paper pronounce and plunge courts i imagine a magic blackboard that if you were worried swan number in rome new thing in all the other numbers would automatically change one word processing with numbers i imagine that my calculator and mel's hardware on the bottom of it and i cannot display like a fighter plane like to take some numbers and circle would impress somebody and right now middle for negotiation i'd be able to get the answer to our descent take my fantasy and turn it into reality my father taught me about protecting he showed me mock ups that he'd make to figure ralph placement on the page for the things for brochures issues from and he uses to get feedback from customers and bouquets before he says the job off to the press is the act of making the simple working version of which are trying to build forces you to uncover key problems at which you find solutions to those problems much less expensive one so i decided over for a time i went and into a video eternal connected to harvard's time sharing system got to work one of the first problems that are ran into was how do you represent values informal is only show you what i mean i thought you would point somewhere tecumseh words that type and solemn from ralph punch numbers more numbers for everyone to cancer and can point to the first of smartest point to the second and get to resolve the problem was what should i put the in the formal inhabit be something the computer knew what to put in that you looked at the formula you needed to know we're on the screen and referred to the first thing that all was the programmer way of doing it the first time you point to somewhere the computer would ask you type in a unique name became great player brief after that was one of the joint chiefs the computer have water matalin make up the name and put it inside so i thought why not make it be the border which you create them to try back now you want them to frequently i saw the movie are more than a few values and every member of the spring funds were i said why not instead of allowing employed values anywhere or restrict you two agree and then when you wanted to sell the computer could put a role in common is a name and if i didn't like the map and put a. b. c. across the top in numbers along the side if you saw the seven in uniform what you know exactly where was on the screen and if he had a title for knowing yourself you know what to do restricting you two agree it helps all my problem it also opened up new capabilities like the ability to have ranges of selves but it wasn't too restrictive you could still play in the value any formula in any self and that's the way we do it to this day almost four years later my friend bob and i decide to work until this brought together by the more work figuring out exactly how the program was supposed to be he wrote reference court to act as documentation it also help me ensure that the user interface close to finding could be explained concisely and clearly traitor people bob work in the back of the apartment that he rented in arlington massachusetts this is the inside of yeah but bob what time on the mit motif system to write computer code wanted terminal like this then he would download test versions full bore a battle to over phone lines using an acoustic cobbler and then we would test out one of these tests i prepare for this case about the pepsi challenge crew was working at so i have a copy everything down save was working to every time it crashed i had had an old formal was again over and over the next day in class reached him like a cold lonely presented the case i defied your projections i did all sorts of different scenarios like the students the suckow was already used for the professor said how did you do it well i wanted to all of our super proved so so what's important is that the small one by the subject for that the civil war user ratio at a ratio that would have been his exact wouldn't say was divide isn't working and i eventually though we did finish one off of this account to be able to show it to the public fight back for another sample reference for the week he uses more to cheer real in june of nineteen seventy nine or publisher and held his account of world in a small booth at the giant national computer conference in your survey out near times had a humorous oracle about the conference the machines performance in religious rights even the believers and even as the believers gathered the pictures of the coliseum site rumor and the pantheon carefully lettering this accounting giant black one yellow all hail to secure a new york times all hangovers itself that was the last convention of the electronic spreadsheet in the popular business press for about two years most people didn't get it yet but some good bye in october of nineteen seventy nine we ship visitor became in packaging mobile like this have looked like this are wanting one the apple to than the rest as they say is history that is an awful lot more the story about how the week for another day one thing though harvard remembers fears that classroom they put all the flak to commemorate what happened there white house it also serves as a reminder that you two should take your unique so you're unique backgrounds skills and needs and bill prototypes to discover and work out the key problems and through that change the world thank you how one
