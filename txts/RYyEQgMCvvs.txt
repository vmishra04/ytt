set right it has landed in china and the first pentagon sheets to ever visit since two thousand forty rising military tensions in the south china sea and the denuclearization of the korean peninsula just two of the major topics like that to be on the agenda for the right alice retired general jack seen a fox news senior strategic allies can also supplied the safe and sergeant joining us in the sewers or got into contact that military readiness last night in south carolina was when he sat where would i would our military our military is now being built up like you wouldn't lane highway huh huh huh and at the u. s. has been strongly politics i as a military build up in the south china sea is one to quote compete vigorously as needed what's your take as masses in china this morning how we're talking about all of these issues and pushed back from china on trade know what we're on a collision course with china geopolitically what are you know what's happened so as we lay some of the late show is fall to soften the last two decades that would that china involved in the world markets if we give three cars imported society which they have developed a consumer base modern society that we may financial investments in china before waters of that then china eventually because of economic watch for a posh party would lead to full approval that has not happened quite the contrary at the nineteen collars chinese commoners board congress president jean could be raining impala and that's the way it is more authoritarian about regime now that may have been a bad enough that is where the heading out to control all the people of approach them when necessary and geopolitically they clearly want a place united states as the dominant country that in the west and the civilian indo pacific and the irony is that is is that it's the united states military help provide the stability of the global commerce in that area that and they raised all boats to whom china's economic prosperity bijeljina now as you mentioned the south china sea and any other thing is to change ugly they flew admitted for the right to know they flow you see the united states as a decline and fall in china as rise and fall to wire replace as the as preeminent global power the world's made a will that get to that now but beyond forty thirty forty forty that's what makes me think that's a clue is achievable by in the cities of the plans for dictator for life and she i had we know that that's why they expect to be number one in things like a high in things like world iraq's blocking technology all the industries that are critical to the growth of america in the coming years but they're going to know how that that's stealing our technology and getting that never was i first might take think intellectual property from the united states the issue here i'm white and your comments on is that they're using against economically and putting it toward their military complex house intelligence to return again and as sheriff for information with me about his investigation into china on sunday morning futures pits that doesn't happen marxist is that it's reaction now first and foremost we're looking at the military for printing potential motors up front that china's trying to put around the globe for this didn't do a lot of fanfare because you're so much attention being paid to the russian fiasco russian collusion but in the meantime the chinese just opened up a brazen military base in djibouti activities of the interests of the red sea and the heart of the police of the movement in the indian ocean all long way away from china now we believe that they're looking at investing in ports and infrastructure around the globe not just for military capabilities but also to control those governments to have to have the ability to lobbing and then manipulative government general your reaction javelin thrower when the charges though world vision of an energy infrastructure and then all the major part of that in the eighties danger insulator in the middle east in eastern europe is all about gaining geo political influence by informs you leaves and the bellman sentinels conferees and they use your own label forced to do it why it why is china so if you stood globally why the billing basis of the jed duvall up some of what the united states is that the reason is the achilles heel is energy that a sixty two percent of the royal comes out in the middle east if we had a conflict with china today we would trial that oil and just to squeeze them gave the layout strategic reserves they they want to make sure that the global commons out in america will columns they have access to and the united states could not sure that all of which clue we have the capability to do that sold they are building a global power projection the base in djibouti given me an emotional regular basis and all the base of pakistan we will see all the bases in africa they have been in the order there have been in the baltics they are projecting power been away is protect them sometime maria what they have mueller school will ambitions at the expense of it out is that exactly at all of this is connected to me this morning we're focused on trade what the president says don in terms it's howard's end and is pushed back on on investment from china into the united states but it's all connected in terms of the power that time that is the conley or has the conn is over i say compliance in this place the united states as the world's most powerful country in recently of course term limits enabling presence hey t. literally definitely as you descend dictator for life on top of consequence of violations of alleged that other american intellectual property to in the field it's passing allies we know that china has been stealing our high tea for decades but they won't admit it still is that is the president like to push back on these talents and what is this the right answer to get china to stop what they wanted it that what they're doing general what they need a comprehensive strategy deal with china not not just that an economic one you needed a comprehensive strategy to deal with bill diplomatically economically and geopolitically dead the reality is is the eighth day of gliding down our allies sovereignty and indo pacific the governor of thirty thousand commercial vessels the work that the peel way the normal to rise and interfere with fishing rights and sovereignty writes i dated because leo at this day in and day out until such time
