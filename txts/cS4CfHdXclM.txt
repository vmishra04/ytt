what a note if there was a conspiracy to be quite easy to reach out to check says because you could find them of the new system would continue a healthy again but the point is the system's never really been healthy of the system of a consensus but not home system is what pathetically some rules it's been set off with legitimizing glorified those rules and because now we're the end of both the benefits of economic growth so the whole thing's compression so what we do what we owe them to follow the rope opens up the problems of people but once it is and so you start losing those behaviors a house of the system you'll never get the system function as it should do so is it a conspiracy no snow is it start to the time and yes it is it's pass on highest until we start in paso's the house when captain so there was a legumes fall on those not consciously but we have to agree that the venues have left the economy and about to shake them which they found it but woods is that what we don't need now is it's generational conflict but generations of me to go to sit down and talk to choke 'em walk out a way to forge ahead and cried and other culminated different how about bob said we cannot collectively it's lives in nevada state of foe the generations coming through on generation x. generation will set out with ethel and we told you those become tribal they would cause of the illinois geology but it unconsciously them forward on the thing they did it with any kind of modest whatsoever on the gist of the woods hole that's how things should go up to the point now is a good rain gauge employs generations to come together and walk out the best way out of this by saying mass an out all flow politicians in the west all professional politicians and about something that doesn't really work because these politicians that have any real world experience understand how a business trudeau rights they have coexisted in the bottom of westminster all washington and that means that that hindered by bill will acknowledge this is no vital to them and so what we need now the two have been involved in the real economy run businesses understand how the economy actually works um but politicians think about the next election statesman think about the next generation will we need now people who've been involved in the real economy on the stand out what i understand that they need to make the placement backs of state richard found it for future generations that is the top of the two of them we won't multiple fashionable to urban dogma and do this people like you know flow of money that the human cost of its eggs to make that kind of money on the human cost a bit sex no so the question to take them on out to the system is something that i'm not interested and find me on this guy's up on me often bamboo delmar amused or the ones to finish the fullest rare biggest on the second one thing though so minge the money that is what they said some glimmers of the second really cannot put something back home all issues that if you could put something back when you got some it should've been taken in the fall of in the gaza and it is a tournament a fool for film and because of won't go to the goldmans ombudsman and stole of wealth will recommend going back to the goldstone we use it to indicate that if you have the money supply that in private hands by his own sense of loss to grow that money supply because that's what profit arts but the outset the goal book says that hold on the stone to reopen coldness both a survey eagle money supply of money supply stability so we need these independent monocle someone off and that needs to be in the hands of the people not in the hands of private institutions that's an effect money supply is to superconductor but a state money supply transplant families live bullets above thirty m. o.'s it by every population think about it in relation to population growth and buy much tried is going on within that sausage is the coast of it to the decent economy you serve on the divorce on a bus thing to do is re examine everything you consult with it is cool university voice like to know what lives island except if it fits your common sense the second thing to do is re engage among the politicians of them i'm all pretty much a colossal destruction so what we have to do is make them work all the folks on this than i did witch that locked into a position of age of politicians most neither the aisle and also says that to set the electorate know the moment of that relationship isn't working to rain gauge made him one top white understanding the vicario economy in a way that they call and question about and i'm takes of polls was burned in the minority of people make you nice but i'm not miss a on just a small called on to swarm of billions will go qualities changes is a little low on because find me that's the thing that bit of attention the system few days acting in concert to rectify local devices will himself when a parade of having no competition will don't think he's a clever option so what to do well to announce a tool to the people who share you'll find uses a pregnant autopacific themselves puppets for the annual uptown city country there's plenty of things that can be done and more important than plenty of things that are being told them i'm bob tool with this film that we've met loads of people who all thinking of doing the same thing that just then a third of what else is thinking and during that would become a moment will be among the lap of this economy on well everyone realizes that through necessity that all acting the way it is actively change next misuses sought to the country's ultimate will i'm so you want us to continue to keep going on up off of the news or bad mix with it version simply budget on region of the time who voted to go to china was so russia because of the flat lots of them but the other reason is that why haven't we haven't was obtained lived under those economists we have very little about expense of the blessing you should make films about the things you know about them so yes the rows of china will have an impact on the wall statement out of my view is that if we organs be relevant in the west the next decade or two decades michigan orion house in order before we start lecturing all the people on how to bomb their home and tell the small countries because most kids was a dim view on a small country by getting this economy didn't would says majority instead of the minority in the fog set to the financial insurance and real estate is but we can do is work with other countries itself magic comes down to the people are out that and then the majority and what could happen is in causes of democracy and light level can be implemented without any stopped by communicating with all this i'm listening because it enough to get open arms and getting a network of people together who want to push for the same kind of reforms so you can go as well i'm and you know isolated when you bench he become the stress of the big so and the sea logbook she called on the internet and audience man's life inside knowledge on it but this is incredible and will continue growing up as we as human beings keep using so yes slightly worried about us and ship because government who gets an a lot to blow the internet and also use call to models to eviscerate walks among the knowledge that is going into the woke to most of the devil and the unit and said uses to be the attitude to violet since monday's is but ultimately human ingenuity poem by crosses all those books of course what we need to keep the very place on on how the new government so going about sends me it's not that ultimately it is an ally it doesn't have a replies that i'm vincent connection between him and things and snatches it's cool and ministers in the same room discuss all of this exchange ideas on and that means jim things mason will always a pox we can do on law and urban ghettos the economic system of float around the century enjoyment on his credit huge amounts of environmental damage and suffering will just sit up humans bubbles are two of the war oklahoma's well i will and at last few moments doesn't exist in this world it's a fair it unnecessary to just below the nipple slip columnist for instance doesn't see land as a unique factor of production in any of the mobiles that very credit set about making flight around with capital and not playing means that we all about then you say you can sense of loss to destroy the pond another thing that i do when they come into the malls to understand the real economy is that another factor that's money or punks into the thing that that you so customer kong's while problems with me for mobile an economy when these things are out of their own that ridiculous to send ideology that has been decisive in academia adam politics of the last hundred years and is deliver this why we are out map of the other thing about it is the mayor koch the economists is the silence and the king of babylon bribery small area of the economy instead of taking up ruled that is to create a while so what we do we get rid of it i'm not stalling to happen find students on to walk out of economics lectures happened often equipment used up to a movie and two thousand them because the men in that but let's say willing to accept this close to signing of this audiotape so they and it cost the economics yes it's delivered as well as the moment it go talk to him to the senate and as of monday says no foam should learn a little bit about to be the shaft and environment and that ultimately it's small any economic system which the piece of software and if you like that humans are a lot able to tolerate any more open the harbor of the planet is with trashing accommodate that says that would be able to bid but say accommodate the middle school ideology so the house to go on the question now wages bosses crosses the line as well to place with and that's exactly what's afoot to sure attention will shift lever place near complete moments we will push it over the place it with the system that puts people on planet thoughts about whether to bite his head so the crosses congress waste that necklace the moment has to go and have to come up with an economic hard on that is called this will unsuitable the twenty first and in was limited so i'm a little assertions by his own policy makers a one on what's them to come on lads hundreds of the things that are telling him private they wouldn't i wouldn't football player sank on camera that's what our men live through all the right track bookish optimistic but if i keep 'em will also having dombeck united with the film because we bumped into thousands of audience members who rule thinking and feeling pretty much the same thing and no longer willing to accept the current status quo set up i think it's the most exciting time to be on on friday and i think that it's a time when people if we all going to make some kind of huge job for humanity we have to do is pick the right kind of change not conscious of education said one thing that out we should remain optimistic that we should also reminded us that sofa education seven have to pay the right kind of change and the other thing which is mobile and to have to be dedicates its process no results as more more younger generations of travel that of these grownups in the world the mobile world with a lot less than save that pool on saw an immense how's that they get more list they will be unpleasant five generations are going to push to change all we have to do is be brave enough to jump into the unknown among the stone wall street across to the process ultimately the results were costumes on a foolish we were fools who will have to do so negative than normal of problems than nicole miller things were going home while smoothing out we were finding the only one of the seventy inspire people doing semi brilliant things around the world so we won't think about doing a sequel the bones were taught about lose bristow is we called no depicted with homo the arab world to capture these aren't so the sequel is that i'm coming soon it is all about holy good things are going on an old maid businesses that are working to go who is working the
