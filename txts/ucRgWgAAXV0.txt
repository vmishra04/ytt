i found on and what what what a break from torn with jordan peterson and joining me in studio today is a free speech lawyer and the director of the individual rights defense program at the foundation for individual rights and education aka fire are no good to the report and chapman was awarded for eight or got freedom stuff in there and then that's all the stuff that i like some look of orders said so you guys fire is an organization is one of them the few bastions of sanity phase they thought i seem to you guys are sweden about and consistently defending the principles of free speech and free expression opening graham always like ah there are some good guys left so first actually just tell me a little bit about the organisation white guys got started have you personally got well we'll start in nineteen ninety nine up with the professor pan and a civil liberties lawyer in philadelphia who where are the fables decided that there were others a problem comes an epidemic in our callers new mercies of the corps individual rights that could make up in our our constitution to few well as individuals as people's citizens of the united states of you for being respected on campuses across the country back in nineteen ninety ninety nine minutes yeah that's interesting because a lot he will say this is just that totally recent phenomena washington allotted to them is the political correctness movement of the eighties and nineties a little bit knew them might have something to do with it but then this is bigger problem since the free speech refer back to berkeley idea long before even these are nineties no censorship is an angel problem it predates the united states of america really i can get as ellen in harvey you know when about creating fire and they decided to locate if we look in philadelphia which is new the birthplace of an asian of the really got the outpouring of people say hey this happened to me to call and they said well this is no this problem is is an epidemic we need to fix it and fire was born amore would you like that but then that got over the years of getting close to twenty how crazy enough of that has actually just gone up every year more and more people reach out to fire for help locked out when i got to fire how to the second time actually was a little fella fire after i graduated from law school for starred in private practice of the one i came back in two thousand thirteen and getting several hundred case admissions ear caught and now we're getting dinner close to a thousand hit rock bottom and that's just the stuff that we hear about the chilean national how much other stuff is going on around the country people who don't know that we're out there to help them albertina people who perhaps go about themselves and it's it's crazy think about how much is going on yeah so i wanna talk about some of those cases in some of the specific work you're doing good foundation for individual rights and education i am a believer right now partly because of a kind awacs and because of a lot of people online right now that the individual is making a comeback that the idea of the individual words the collective is actually making a comeback would you have any idea when they came up with a name for fire wives so awkward with the individual front and center oh i think it should have been speaking get out of some old ignorance because i have actually discussed this with either of them personally but you know if i had to guess it's it's because the the individual qualities the freedom of conscience the freedom of speech the things that allow us to participate in society we don't get to the collective unless we have the individuals one is necessary to have the other is what is a collective other than a group of individuals and consensus is a bunch of individual opinions that throughout the process of winnowing the being different good ideas that ideas reach a common understanding we reach the uh you know that the norm for society and that's how that's why free speech particularly so for tuesday's that's how we get to the optimal resolution the optimal conclusions and that's how we reached he's communal positions is only through our own personal expressions of what we believe which exposes us to criticism or agreements are just flat out discussion with other people say anything the ideas of the collective to room so much a college campus well i think is that didn't hate in society at large that we really go through every once in awhile in terms of thinking about things as individualistic and then worry about broader concerns of the community and it's not altogether a bad thing i think the college campus and it's always been this way some microcosm of what we're experiencing a broader society nothing that's another reason why it's so important to protect individual rights and hauge campuses of because when they fall on horse campuses their own certainly shortfall in society writ large yeah so that actually we discussed it briefly river can return on that's my concern is that it's what people say oh you know there isn't a free speech issue on college campuses and even like to go to college campuses very clear to me that there is a free speech amir that it's not what's gonna happen it's not just the screaming kids right now it's not that that these are the people that are going to be in your shoe positions five ten fifteen years in the future and and further than that obviously if those ideas the world because they were able to silence call us once they are the lawmakers what's there and in charge of public policy we're not privy to cry to the people whom they were silencing way back we're yeah mean that's really one of the key proms and it's not in just the stage elected the power unit they are collected and the dough rise to power in the can impose these years and other people these are our future citizens even if they're not necessarily future leaders who ended up in discourse of the nation if that is the key prevalent feeling in society is going to suffer tremendously is results if even if they're not in congress or the state legislatures in fifty percent of the country's population jinx it should be talking about certain things we're not going to talk about these things and it's going to be a societal imposed if nothing else and i think that's incredibly damaging to just about every aspect of our life is is a country that it's so interesting to me because i know you see you read about this but i was at the university of new hampshire couple weeks ago and you know force we were supposed to give the speech on campus then about two hours before they announced that they could secure the room that they felt they were too many threats so they were about two hundred forty people's was to be in the room they moved us to the hockey rink we should seek seven thousand five hundred people so i stood in front of a little you know backdrop i talked about two and a peaceful was about a hundred fifty people that were there listening be respectful and i'll accept the rabbi about fifty protesters roughly was a rough numbers of what they desire just to shout out to use you always makers to scream to chant like robots they love robotic checked all of these things and i kept saying to them guys together the direct question we say something that i'd say that you disagree with the war is there something you directly like to ask me and time and time again the answer was no and i don't know how are you break a matter that bothered him keep having conversations and hope that the refugees make it tough as a common problem and i think it really comes down to ideological purity that people are after the idea that if i disagree with you on something whether small or even fundamental ideas we disagree with you on that one thing that means nothing to do you have to say could possibly be of value to me and that is completely false you can beef up farther from the truth we can learn so much from the people we disagree with the most the f. i disagree with you on absolutely everything he could still be incredibly valuable for me to talk to you if only because that helps me sharpton and really understand why i believe what i believe in and people really discount the importance of understanding why you believe something the acid or two in the making for a while is that i do think right now at least in twenty eighth and this is more probable left the table we id than married a college campus discussion in academia and medial at the moment for so long that the reason these kids end up being released you instead of being so hysterical is because they endeavored your counter ideas to then you get a pretty moderate guy who's arguing about liberty and freedom for everybody including let live and that actually got to move them because they never hear anything outside of what you're being taught that goes to get together for the votes of why people do know really crappy job of educating students before they get to college about why free speech and our other rights are important civics education is clearly in the toilet but tower law and it's bizarre to me i grew up in skokie illinois one of his sights on the most famous free speech case is now in recent history get you lay it out further the villain of the story in the seventies the american good american socialist party that nationals party the illinois nazis if you thus the blues brothers that wanted to march to skokie illinois which outside of new york had the largest concentration of all cars survivors the united states i unskilled shrine to soften the end of the suit with the unity of the american civil liberties union of all knowledge and it went to all to supreme court elroy on the supreme court united states caught in the nazis had the right to march and then the courts held cell in there were threats of violence and disruption and all you know people out crying as to how this could be allowed but ultimately the nazis have first amendment rights marchers dopey and i grew up learning about that case very young age and to tell you how many times i saw the movie painted upon it ended it really got me thinking a young age about why this is important how i think about it and i can tell you that as a young child i completely agree the nazi should have a right to march in the light on how speculate how did we didn't grasp the over arching fundamental importance of free speech but i was thinking about it just like out there and i get the feeling that sometimes we're not doing enough to make her students think about whites or get it such an important case i'm greg you mentioned it because it was really to the horrid acts that the key poll that lived in skokie as you said the second largest metropolitan survivors in the country these people literally survived the genocide probably virtually all of them lost some of the violence all of their family members and friends in all of that and yet i would secure as someone that was all about survivors on both sides my family and tell you it was the right decision you can lead to the nazis to white supremacist river there you kill him sir ransacking property it to start killing people are harming people but letting letting them arch that's an exchange of free speech and it's kind of shitty but you gotta defend it would target offend be out to china when it's hard to defend because otherwise this is not to be around to defend one's easy to defend you know once you start creating exceptions in encroaching that is no end to it and know we've kind of seemed even in other countries that once this is encroachments start it's always will make an exception and just as one other small exception in this inevitably another one and another one in all for perhaps even you could do reasons in terms of the ideals and into the goals are laudable perhaps as every show the rodeos baber good as getting fair to say half of the evil throughout all of that now and it's really a practically speaking it's inevitable now how much of this is just a confusion as to what the first amendment that's also what i've started to realize because when i got on college campuses the protesters are there i always say i welcome peaceful protests are completely welcome i welcome the exchange of ideas the questions all of that when when they're screaming about through the fighting there is just a disconnect as to why did i come to legal protecting what the first amendment is what hate speech is a is awarded didn't have to john raedler okay i'd die if i had to hit here were more person whether it be student at the end commoner terror and jo loesser faculty member sometimes say he'd spacious not free speech and lose it will have to let us do that is a sight i really i mean this'll be maybe we come over this episode but i've really want people to understand is why is the speech free speech well i'll leave allow the speeches free speech because of the first amendment and then the courts have said nothing about free speaker hate speech being on protected by the first minute speech is protected by the first amendment allows it falls under one of the phillies you existing categories on protected speech yeah where were those very words others incitement to imminent lawless action time he saw a very high bars for threats and intimidation of you can be sued for libel or slander defamation us are now about sums states and action still have criminal statutes on top of books but they're rarely enforced while fraud obscenity which people often confused with near profanity a witness but they're not the same thing by extension the imagination what's the difference is that well presented in goodness are generally protected by the first amendment obscenity is the very high bar it's speech that has to be our expression that i should say in her bra that trust each other has to appeal to the prurient interest which is important fascination with sacks cannot describe rejected saxena patently offensive way and have no social political literary artistic value whatsoever and says the kid down and that in mind that they are of crush idiots are fewer to have a lot of her for and they are videos of women wearing stilettos crushing small animals like hamsters intervals tibetan people apparently get off on its haven't i don't i can't understand it even if that is not wholly and protected by the obscenity exception to the first and that that's particularly interesting cases suppose because the idea of a talking about it seems like i would have no problem with that of the action itself probably there some legal visas re regulated killing animals there is some till i guess it drives a lot right but if you have this love pornography ashen color that i just i have a hard time getting it back on it if you haven't been to possess an ally sinn is ought you can be prosecuted for for possessing an obscene material it's interesting distinction that impact is the cry or the act is what is illegal not be the picture picture of ours is having a field reached an answer for that child pornography obviously not protected by the first amendment got caught up with this cloth is the one additional wrinkle of the fighting words doctrine all the others considerable doubt that remains a viable up exception to the first amendment but he really does bought a lot in hate speech today to go to the extent it's still exists is limited to face to face interactions in where's the ice is something to you that is so insane lead uses the u. are likely to punch me in the face without thinking twice about it instead of to deep breath can hear ignoring your coming back at the end is reasons why it's fallen into disuse it's worth while to know that supreme court has upheld the fighting words convictions since the case in the forties when it created a fighting rocks at a good hinges how far it's fall into disuse incentive ices hundred people on the face right the creates an easy way to censor the people who disagree with that it would arrive soon be some level of this objective piece of information as to what you think is offensive in the highest order is given perhaps the one i think orchids are the words of in the attic it creates terrible incentives and you would basically lead to institutionalize hecklers ego bob so it's really not tenable yeah sort it all the hate speech for which we clear what the supreme court said about hate speech you're allowed to do agree with these exceptions that you just laid out you're allowed to see things what i would i'm realizing on college campuses says they've really don't like her at the people that the senate to work for what they really don't like that so like they figured fusillade you it's just that you were allowed to say bad things you can say it'll lynchings you can say i edelweiss people the gays or whatever you can say you can't course direct call to violence before i think the the the is that if you keep saying those things i hate these people that it's going to incite violence now my count toward him it would be no you have to use free speech to counter those bad idea is that the purpose of free speech but do you see that that that seems to be the slope that they consistently are they do we allow you to say i i hate these people which has begun a new bridges all those things but it's up forty two eyes out by the bill of rights they think that that's going to be a unified thai honey come back that notion if you move but well at a midday something that we tend to your law first amendment world and you know first of all generally speaking in this country we punish the people and to the backpacks if i watch your show and i get some kooky idea i'm dawson yelled to make some crime what i can assure you in jail because an idiot to the terrible idea that you didn't check take right now so i might be different or fire was up you're saying you should violently attacked these people are terrified exactly and that's why the incitement standard is so high he has to be likely to incite n. intended to incite the ne yet criminal auction of self i tell you a get out of the fun of burned out building but you're not likely to do it i knew him to take it as a joke i probably haven't you know committed any kind of fucked now lawful expression if i know you're about a maniac as they had us have burned out buildings where i liked him by myself a very different situation i saved your life that is about eight years old either but that i think that if you take a look on my colleague section of the peace for equal at night so long ago about the rwandan genocide been looking over the claims that the radio broadcasts actually you cause more violence of what it turns out is that the radio broadcasts first of all only incited people who were already predisposed to what he felt that way and they may be partially easier for them to find people and you know be taught how to do certain things of god he was relatively ineffective as it turns out in convincing people who were already in a perverse range to go out and commit by it's gotten so you know and i think that the figurehead along these views the air is going to indisputably cause actual violence he is somewhat overblown that was a second part two images that people expressing these views might lead to more people adopting those season having prejudiced youths who is that possible that absolutely right about the corners for the best kind of a point is that we put those she's out there so we can find of him if we don't have them in public and we can't fight them to stillness fred nothing no idea ever went away because he said you can't say that it just doesn't work like that yeah how's the hecklers vigo fit into all of this because one of the things that i go again see on college campuses is one heckler start screaming at you can really say just said you know forget your questionnaire calm down or whatever you have my say ah i'm a single i have a right to free speech to the charter flickered on you they go write the book that actually cannot come in getting but i will give them a little bit of credit i think to say at university of fat in somebody comes in and they chant for thirty seconds it was to stand up and turned their backs and that's the extent of it i think that we should protect that technically are the causing disruption yes but it's minimal and affection maximize the amount of free she just leave some room for a very minimal disruption yet when it gets to play with their substantially interfering with speakers of ability to get their message across or the audience isn't going to hear them through repeated shouting or noise makers or standing up for blocking of one's views are up and things like that obviously that's a problem in last year we just saw a rash of a package deals going on in it can all started with berkeley and wiley about what's the aho when they protesters were successful in shutting down the event through word of what had left before that and unfathomable on a college campus for invited speaker we've seen invited speaker controversy since flat was founded basically to an never ever in my aware of any incident that came close to something like that he was just and it's the out and they got away with it the so few wrestler vaden accountable wonder if these students out of the word for college word charles murray was speaking seized on that can look to the berkeley students and said well there were successful in stopping that event with speech that we also detested can they got away with it so let's try that it's a viable tactic this might be a solution for keeping the speech we disagree with off campus out and ideas like that that the tactics that students are able to successfully utilize the whale behavior that is what essentially is going to be repeated hat icy that all over the place right now so for example just a couple months after mile away to berkeley about having a bunch of yours will clear it was largely non violent but it cost the university six hundred thousand dollars to make that happen i mean i think an atm was broken koppel witnesses that say but that's part of the tactic is if we can keep reading that so we'll keep pushing the security cost of had they had to move by eventual free in hockey theater that pat me on the reenact admit cheap and and several other cities are so i'm sure you're familiar case of windy shepherd of the world gregorian canada and she just had to clarify that the ground six grand to get security for one of her events so that almost seems like the new tactic it's almost like we are there we can scare them with some threats of violence in some other stuff and the cause the security costs to be so high that you guys are just about one that's another probably been fighting since even before all this came to head is our colleges universities trying to charge student group security fees for the speaker's based on the anticipated protesters illiteracy and that's clearly unconstitutional has been for a long time since the supreme court said that all this year's reaction is not the content neutral basis for regulation and you cannot charge more for controversial speakers because they might try protest that places of a price tag on expression in places like you said the hill price the controversial expression on the market place they're not going to be able to afford a western group has seventeen thousand dollars to spend on security none of that era in haiti know what comes out his administrators at the university itself has to be the guarantor of last resort when it comes to the speaker's believed speak in this is the basis that are in and sometimes it's unpleasant and sometimes it costs a whole lot of money but if you're not going to have a campus will we can discuss things and you can debate things you think it's loud and boisterous and raucous and contentious which is everything free speech should be out if your campus isn't going to be a place with that occurs then were you are you doing so i do wanna make a point in saying that some of the campuses are getting it right i'm sure you know summer camp as that are doing better easily others other for example look back at the beginning of september the twenty seventh united will declare moment an actor for the undoing of free speech push because of what happened this semester before with heather mcdonald all hell broke loose on the campus and i was quickly welcome there and be even some of the students who disagree with a chance to help the questions and then all of that except the region or i would think it would mention with some schools are doing their best to manage to it's absolutely on two levels i think you're first of all fire rates policies of schools we read over four hundred different colleges universities on our red light yellow light green light level of bread like being you have policies that are clearly in substantially unconstitutional yellow light being your policies that are susceptible to being applied in that way is smooth and green light schools we're out of their policies poses a serious threat to free speech in the past couple years the number of green light schools that we have has nearly doubled called which is a tremendous moon and now still close to sixty percent schools have a yellow lights of this work to be don hot button combine that with the thirty eight schools have now put out statements expressly committing themselves to free speech of something that you know the worst in chicago titania while that of the there's reason to hopefully works regularly with administrators who were happy to help us you know consult on their paul season saved no cure the changes we've make i can endure we have an correlations with so many administrators which is really gratify but on the students i also his heart is overblown i think when yet there are a lot of students out there who can get that gun people of all ideologies and all political to you know science their alatas turns out there who get i speak to them on a daily basis million get there he is a lot of reasons to to have all i guess i'm not lost cause though i agree i think it's important talking about it because even again at that universe and everything are seventy five percent or at least with their respectfully be silly to your ideas and you that when i thought was important after a wife who would talk about have you here alive is because i wanted to be born with the right or even so that when these the center of people even if it's just the smaller said it's just really loud to as a disproportionate influence on our people to understand there are tactics you can use to divide it appears on that list of thirty eight schools that scribe you are right right now we may be instituted some baseball season or member one universe asia corroborated that you're go um is there evidence that things actually get better 'cause i got a guess that when you get some rules some of these is due to wanna be kicked out of school and they might actually get even better well so i think the service does lot of conversation right how about some legislation even that's going on about con disrupting speeches mandatory punishments for students to do so sir number of times and he i think that's actually less important actually have a son of a problem with laws that create mandatory punishments for vaguely defined in terms like this rock which you could be applied to pretty much anything the nazis to have access but i think i'm more important he is one administration is saying hey these are the values that really that this is the wellspring of intellectual vitality that are institutionalize i have bodies of the good deals he should be paying attention to this is what's gonna meet europe's periods really worth while i think students will listen to that instead of meeting the policies of say thou shalt not saying mean things about you'd ironclad states thought that gets you to the very different mindset when they come to college life where the statements for the principles that you had you guys wanna see that the that the principles are just largely this is a place of debate this is a place of intellectual exploration it is not our job is administrator source faculty members to silence ideas that we find controversial or protect you from these are our job is our mission to expose you even to ideas that you might disagree with indeed even schools the to penalize them for the critically about them formulate your own ideas and participate in the conversation 'cause that's you'd have to do when you leave after four or however many years you hear that part of life in our democracy is participation if he'll participate then you know is the same as hilbert as they have no grounds to comply on reacted didn't really get students in the mind set that these are important life skills and important even in other instances into workplace they can be important if you have a new policy position if you work in a company that you think is either that or what you want promote you to be able to think about the people who would disagree with you in what they're going to say anticipate their response been formulated argument that resolves its don't discount the situations in the world outside a college where being able to think wrigley is incredibly important and it really i think that you get a lot of value out of doing that outside the classroom 'cause it teaches you how to compare to live the scale that teaches you how to apply it not just indeed i read this assignment let's talk about it kind of way 'cause that's willing i'll fight for its was a graduate i wish you wasn't it as a whole lot simpler half that you get a job for you that's true and have to find something else to head an found moved one hot on how found and up
