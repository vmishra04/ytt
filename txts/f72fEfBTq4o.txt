house house has the story would monsanto's round up begins as early as the nineteen eighties when laboratory tests and was the same began to show cellular changes in laboratory animals bitches and consider early signals of relationship clearly the cancer in fact in nineteen eighty five the indeterminate life was a which is the primary ingredient of roundup needed to be classified as a classy carcinogen which meant that clearly is suggested the role of the relationship cancer but then miraculously for some reason six years later the peace only change that classification the sampling just the opposite now they were saying that there were wrong to classified as a possible carcinogen and that the public had nothing to worry about when using products that contain this chemical that was their change then all of us out in the lavatory data from the early eighties the vp a huge declassified why the state of cancer suddenly became unavailable to the public why because monsanto warning that all the early testing results for this chemical fell under protection of crazy which ruled me didn't have to share this information with the general public it was there's they're relatively quiet the reason that story from the nineteen eighties and itineraries is important is because the same stories play itself out time after time with montana's and round up studies will show that it causes cancer clearly monsanto intervenes in some way those same scientific agency says there's no link the cancer whatsoever is that these war changed because new evidence emerged beijing's because monsanto wanted to make more money no matter how many lives because it's none of my july's how joining me now to talk about this is gary gilmore authored the book why was this story of weed killer cancer in corruption of science carry the big got big word right there's cancer it scared the bee gees is out of everybody is saying that they might be using the weed killer in their backyard every day that has a propensity to gaza encountered cancer but i'm looking at is that it's in this every single lou overwhelming the world health organization comes out is as yet this will cause a non hodgkins lymphoma the gap is the competence still doing everything they can to try to say no that is not now is what your take on here what gerdes a arnold kanter which he added the cancer question is deaf only been one with this chemical units was widely used that our panel call a world of riots underwater for their own bodies i knew right gain international agencies for research on cancer looked at decades of epidemiology and toxicology i researchers said this looks like a probable human carcinogen with strong ties to non hodgkins lymphoma specifically was enough as all of that research is wrong this international agency is wrong and it ended this project is ill among the safest in the world when the safest for people to me it's basically when i line of the literature an alligator resigned we know in the eighties we were told by the e. p. a. yeah this causes cancer than i needed didn't cause cancer and in between there you have doctors scientists at the scientists say you know why it does cause cancer in you still have the aviary in the back pocket of this company's they're all well we'll have enough information you have the u. s. government right they're coming to the aid you have the media is done such a miserable you for job telling us what is what about the state most people don't understand how dangerous this product is why has there been this constant back and forth about round up is whether or not that it's carcinogen on what what is this back and forth all about he can sell are in piano are around the ph toxicologist you're right back to the nineteen eighties looked at the sound of canals daddy the monsanto is said that to lead any signs for showing you two hours these are very rare and on tumors in mice they receive life as saying the toxicologist for the p. ace and at that time while this looks like the stuff can cause cancer i and they were very concerned about and they wanted to read it that way and monsanto pushed back this was in the eighties again was helped push back very hard and all to allay convince the ph a discount in l. when its own toxicologist were telling and to declare this to be a safe product has what you've seen over the decades in the eighties and nineties and again and again scientists warn about the findings of the wife is a pond on laboratory animals and epidemiology in humans daddy's of exposure people and in raising their arms and trying to re vote waiver red flag about this chemical for years in many countries many scientists around the world and every time monsanto has said there were all has sought to discredit the scientist and to discredit the research that isn't this ought to raise an alarm bell around us chemical and they're still doing an end and mrs created a debate in our round the world not only the united states but in europe and many other countries about how safe are not safe as early as a while the latest say something i've got read your book is excellent they embody who wants to know willie what's been happening about his job to read the book whitewash are following year for years for what you've written as a journalist in agriculture is overwhelming you have the information you've what did you do it all sides are just both sides you look at all sides here in you concluded they if i read your book properly there's been a cover up being there's been an attempt by the corporation monsanto to try to push back on sides actually create their own sides to make it look like round that is perfectly safe they are when the third quarter so troubling me these you've gotten we get no help from the eap am actually telling the truth what is your take on that and i get that right or is the worst they now you did desolate any mrs been away then describe this to people in in allied was asked to come to europe in his speech to parliament at this isn't really decades of deception and that's what we'll stand to it seems like a pretty strong thing to say that it is decades and deceptive tactics to find it's a giant chemical company that wants to make billions of dollars tried to deflect i tell her we're asked to discredit to suppress any information that would be useful to consumers in useful to these people who are being exposed to this chemical to decide if they wanna use it or not to decide if if if they want their children playing in the yard that they sprayed with round of people haven't had that choice really because the information about were asked has been head of all the company has trumpeted and pop that information about verwoerd n. n. in doing so they've they've employed you know multiple strategies been ghost written certain scientific papers and david trotted out surrogates both within the u. k. and that perfect and universities around the country to try to control the public narrative and try to control what the public knows about this what the public doesn't yet what what what we clear that when you say it goes right in wide use of the viewers understand that's where the company rights for your call they put the put every word in that or they give that article to some care of harvard yale princeton or wherever they say you know how to lie to make another hundred thousand dollars yeah we're okay just signed the article that we just on the stand either we didn't do we wrote him make it sound like the jurors now this is an organization that is a master of that they're the master of ghost writing most of the stuff that they've turned out about the safety of this has been written by the company given to a third party asset there are four to put their name on it and then told bob would be better for you what you think about one and one eighth lonely show you some here in uganda were you get the world health organization ok this is an organization that for decades has been telling us what will cause cancer you want won't cause cancer they come out and they say yeah round up is it probable cancer cause or an a and m. himself rather than monsanto's say what gee maybe we out more about that instead what they're trying to do now is the fonder the world health organization because the world health organization says something that's gonna hurt their profits by the demure to homer yeah i mean they definitely didn't you can see in the documentation and the monsanto anticipated that it the world health organization's the cancer scientist would find life is said to be a probable human carcinogen or a possible bathing in living in the research was out there if they knew they were worried that this would happen and he laid out a plan to discredit these international cancer scientists before they even had before the cancer scientists even took a look at life to save the funding to clarinet a probable human carcinogen and santa was preparing to discredit them and that's exactly what they've been doing since avatar to twenty fifteen is perpetually false narratives and that efforts to try to tear down this classification and i have gotten so friendly republicans on capitol hill high in washington d. c. to carry forth that message in there looking now i'd have possibly trying to define dire here's a. hearings kept alive for february the sixth to take a look at some of these matters of the ted it's a really powerful low by powerful company to try to take on the center national cancer scientists more than ours are said yeah i you know come through all nonsense we looked at it your product causes cancer it causes a deadly cancer called non hodgkins lymphoma so don't tell us a dozen are all sides looked at it and so there is a monsanto's not happy with that because it sets on this is a recent farming and so now what they wanna do is they're wanted their money away from it when the ashes of abuse of a common practice now i have handled many many former civil cases and in in in farming cases where we've seen this practice stage plays with the cooperation interferes with the scientific community decides if tunisia say what warning warning warning this stuff the dangers in the company interferes with waited outside spews out there but i can't tell you stop in this case i have never seen so much interference with the the dissemination of science that tells a mother that the job should not be playing in the grass after round up is great because it will cause cancer or people who were around every day that he uses is gonna cost eventually what is about what how would you quantify the interference by this company with the scientific community yeah i mean and certainly don't have the range of experience i deficit with tort cases in chengdu and chemicals that of all the different information that's come out from the scientists around the world and different ways of this chemical can be dangerous kind to people and to me and i had any that the whole nother round but i don't see any example where was that have had said yeah you're right yeah maybe we should take a look at irving should worry about that announcing that he's saying no no there were all made discredit that it's a valid one santa was right in every independent scientists that there is wrong thea curry favor of the great work everybody should read your book it is a mind warped could you read this it'll scare the jews the you that ran round of anywhere around outside
