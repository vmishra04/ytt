scientists have developed a handheld ways are they can kill mosquitoes in high volume and they're hoping that this will help combat one of the world's most deadly diseases are high speed video camera that captures up to six thousand frames per second which used by a company called intellectual ventures to show the invention of action but first to starting the flight dynamics of mosquitoes the scientists recorded their flight movements in this video tiny suspended water droplets illuminated by agreeing laser show the movement of air around the mosquitoes way in this video mosquitoes flight was recorded and we're seeing it in extreme slow motion to get this footage of miscue was placed in a custom designed chamber of the center one mosquito flew through the focal point of the camera waiter after starting the data and setting up the system the spinners are shot and killed by lasers here you can see the waiter strike parts of the ski over again off and the body falling to the graph fifth lady in real time you say that would be about one tenth of the second the goal of this research is combating malaria the disease spread through tropical regions of the world by mosquitoes nearly a million people die of the disease you intellectual ventures as their involvement began with a challenge from the bill with no with the gates foundation to set up their system the scientist created what they call a photon effect which in the field would have a beam of the infrared light between fence post the system detects musketeers and shoot them down the inventors claim all the way his report came from the expense of consumer electronics they also quite the system can distinguish between different sets it would only target mosquitoes and one other such as butterflies and bumble bees to pass through on horseback the system could even distinguish between male and female mosquitoes based on there we didn't this is important because only female mosquitoes bite humans and how
