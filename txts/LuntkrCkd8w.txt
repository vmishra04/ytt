people of each and every faith with the dignity they deserve to protect the right to practice their religion or no religion that matter that in the way that they want to wipe it down that on iran their airspace and sundry matters remarks by convoluted had fall out what it supporting because because i have ever be severed these critics and you're raising yesterday time i've worked closely with muslim leaders with muslim countries the cia is it how it looks thousands of muslim wives turn my fifteen months this is that this is at the core of why i'm center booker in on that promise you that
