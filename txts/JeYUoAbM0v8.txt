i don't want to we're continuing our partnership with learn liberty this weekend joining me today is a senior fellow at the murky the center at george mason university as well as a professor of economics at george mason don't grow welcome to the river for happy to be here i am glad you're here i saw you speak about a year ago in dallas elegant exact title of the speech right that he was called can we bring sound economic thinking to washington as tells to ask that was the hour ago and that the pink as much sound economic begin were sound thinking in washington forget economics for a second these things don't seem to go against it now washington seemed to tell us something and it's it's it it's a bit to the tracks on something that would even go so we sat where are we in unique that whatever he needs outwardly the time so the ata the osborn nineteen fifty eight so i came of age what we're all worried about not knowing that you're the end of the color administration which in corners pushing for the rhetorical is accepting the regulation taxes are being clear want to be related to each of position being to really reduce what the nineteen eighty milton friedman it has is popular show on p. b. s. call for you to choose well you know thomas on a bill thomas soul was the scene for the whirled hydra head and so in my life in my life there was a curator the past when this thinking was more sow bug quibble with that yeah but compared to today it was that was the outstanding because it's desolate it's desolate be caught now it's hard to imagine that around the time of jimmy carter did the regulation of that that democrats could add anything to do with that and yet they get addicted to it a was a major force behind airline deregulation so there was so that was something of a ritual was exactly was something in the er leah of story in the late seventies the sociology of minutes of our exit permit the cease fire with what will win and i call one eight to nineteen eighty nine with the collapse of the postpone the iron curtain in nineteen ninety one the corpses soviet union and then he will or twenty eighteen and a lot of nonsense is back on the front burner that sense it is back so let's jump back go to the seventies with seconded by watching interview with you this morning something happened to you i believe in nineteen seventy seven that that will you open it to get sort of is a nice entry into everything else in an ordinary day i die as most important in avenue nineteen seventy seven ego republicans didn't know what is your good the day which was woo woo woo is january twenty fourth nineteen seventy seven about the was a bum i i i was in squalid to what to do some other my plan was to drink beer cheese curls adorable for more of a successful blather that both of them at a college and workaday shut your mouth hours were joined in a class to fit my sketch of the lamond it was a florida court subject is costly debunks the vote was to get up and the time i had a great teacher and so she can support an incursion awards of what happens on the cover of defense the price of something from rising to do more to live with greater shortage just there with a gasoline shortage of nineteen seventy three is the house post in those and i just took the beauty of this economic explanation for the gasoline shortage was so spectacular more of what we're about the subject and so the other shore or additional mob of economics and so all of the two sir that's so tell me what happened after that to the back years for him and what what sort of what academic reasons that you have a tightly are overlooked a big and she was really good teacher and it was a famous apostles of issues are very good teacher she took it agreed to just as she taught economics is a force of the relevant to the real world of it is a mathematical at postal ballot and it was not regarding that my soul of the stomach and state university to the losing out his visitor small school that i have another profession they are cool was into milton friedman into high up on him to live on pieces into james buchanan who later became my colleague forsman essentially go to his office and still feels the beginnings books on average what disappearance of these books that is made so much sense to me are realizing read these books that all my life i give much thought to politics not much cautious still well below my wife by having some would even saw you was a classic liberal or or libertarian someone who will lead to use that basically been polite about all the people's business the to him then ended and no need to white least it's downright it's downright offensive to do so that you just said to my buzz phrases so classical liberal and libertarian what are the questions i get most because i define i'd say that i'm a classic liberal if i knew if i didn't label on it that's what i am the people will always a bead bizarre talk about many things that you teach about free markets and stopped and i believe that freedom is the best way for humans to flourish people thinking you're really libertarian urges holding on to this definition of liberalism from eighteen whatever to do you see a meaningful how would you define twenty see a meaningful distinct adults too much of a decision depends what you talked to some people see see distinctions going with the girls have in common with the distinction that the more june and during the ten to deal with more radical thought about that paid a what distinguishes classic liberal second libertarians inside of our blood from almost any other political group why is that consistent by a belief that any exercise of power by the state must be a huge burden of proof of that good that the burden of proof is not appear on the individual to make the case for his or her freedom it's up on the state to make the case to be true to to override a free and i'd believe in the pool of jurors class what was i think of them believe that that burden is real one and it's a heavy want somebody to net but too often the reverse is in place people believe that you have to get the burden is on those of us who will defend freedom and make the case for free and i think it's backwards so basically you view it as river bottom up way of looking at a divided city to that individual first in the government is not giving you your freedom he can take it away however by instituting all sorts of policies yeah i gotta time in this case on him but that thing john locke was writing john locke those of you would proceed but john locke most famously the maybe or given in the city lieutenant in the seventies and government that of a new human beings have rights and human beings don't need to the government of how words that you bet that those who do the delegation will leave or appropriate for the government to defend those rights and down the dick van capable bottle historically accurate that is what by what i think that perspective is philosophically crew worked there i thought no government gives me you were you try to governments are excellent apple funding right since taking them away out below but that just because government is to protect affords us a meeting gives our first is that goes for words on because you couldn't live without former says no one can soon and begged and a dude ranching little store of the doesn't mean that we or our bodies two forms of blood great things about the size that we live in this suit is what i call the great society to be distinguish one to johnson's great society that is is a society over many many individual each specialized in the doing various things were recorded and a pre system in by the rule of law but adds to the age of this makes a contribution to the will for your boat dollars but no one wants is totally essential and that's a bad that that's experts are it's really good system of belief yes i wanna talk more but i can love it because you wrote a cafe i can live and you mentioned the burden of proof that the government has to meet to say when it's right to actually infringe on some your age or were basically buildings have to this is where i would say that the classic liberal and liver transitions are loaded effort i see some utility for the state avoid usually wanted done at the at the state level that the federal level at which it is sort of hard to begin on when it's nothing you you alluded to that when you talk to libertarians had here get to a place for where it's not you're sing your conflict with habitually you just get mad max movie people to whom are boiled order to undergo capital is which i enjoy talking to but i view it as more of an intellectual exercise then practical doubt i bother sympathetic to our book of philosophically and i'm not a commodity bow load well culpable things up cadogan don't worry too much of a high iq to understand you just came up to replace social situations wholesale good assign a hamster you've evolved where was going to be elected in march from being a real it's having you could blow up either but well yes you going to vote would history is a lot of and really telling examples about attempts to blow up societies wholesale of those examples of ever turned out well we're in practice about those elicit that the only people who will call themselves classical liberals but that none of them wherever it would have risked expressing sympathy for elegant was an all new battalions some of them also know i bought by bullied his role for government but you have two questions of which are so who say the least of at least in principle by the way the society could exist with powell any formal institution of monopolize courtship and i i am in the latter whether they are i might be the one classic liberal who do it or maybe that the day by that definition of all aboard the rigidity of bingo there were you literally so the narcissism of small difference in the zachary in this little bizarre to what are some of the basic principles you your professor with the basic principles that people should know about economics i don't know why there would have someone watching this and adds waiting for their nineteen seventy seven moment yeah that is so by buddy no particular order or no one scarcity of some of what we live in the world skiers were sources which means that if you lose some resources to do this good thing you take the resources away from the building to do all the good things about good things that we have to choose to what it is good thing that you would do that good for the second thing to do ballet or to make that decision about what the people involved you're going to be affected both by the loss of that which is not donvan by the benefit of that which is don't to express their opinions honestly compound valuable is this thing that we propose to do that how valuable is plain that we propose to develop in order to do this first day and had to do that we need you need people on the breast were actually affected by these decisions that have been that the meaningful say you know what a third party looking down making declarations and i think you should have that i think you should not have had that so the social mechanism that gives each of us as much as it is possible in awe of how we use resources and been done to make the evaluations about what would the what'll happen if we use resources way will be about we use resources in this way that that's important unintended consequences is another important that concept by you know adam smith in the wealth of nations which is widely considered to be the store story of one of more scientific economics he's the famously top of the invisible hand and as a poet says the sullivan of unintended consequences kind of exclamations now from the devil to the bush of the brewer the baker that we expect of rubber from there we're going to their own interest about the eap they don't dislike you are the values of customer but there are doing their jobs not primarily to help him they're doing their jobs to help themselves and and you're buying from them not harbor with the help them but palmer with the help you with your family and i'll wait everyone services of good unintended consequence began the abandonment of the consequences as well about my favorite examples of the armed to the consequences the minimum wage reasonable wage it looks like helping will still workers if the light of some of them but effectively mobiles the workers out of jobs and keep him on the job market for longer than to coddle us but what makes a good columns which things are the calls were better calls for the cards is accused of consistency in asking questions always asking as compared to what is compared to what we did that come from how we gonna pay for that what did this cost all will be walled from consequences go down the road beyond the immediate one says that everyone can see this is just that is just the consistency of asking those questions you as funny as your answering the question it keeps making me think all these shows you why politics is so screwed up because they get up there all politicians on either side either say fifteen dollar minimum wage for your trouble better cut taxes on you or the the love their bumper stickers the bill but nobody's ever said unintended consequences of a presidential debate to how frustrated with the idea is an economist listening to people who were not economists who've really are experts in much of anything out of aretha for created a business or they did anyone they dollar off and i'm not aware of that what i've heard that that was the incredibly frustrating to hear your non brooms talk about the things that you're pro be just a minute you know to be special for us to but it's not rocket scientist and an i. m. f. that pile of economics or i'll buy professional i really admired the best among my profession colleagues of milton friedman hi eric up but it's not rocket scientists justice consistency of always understanding that there are all the consequences beyond the immediate about that but there's always the cost to solve the thought that no matter how beneficial something is asked to do with against the cost to the simple thought that that is the simple understanding the consistency of flying up understanding is that difficult but so few people don't so this is frustrating bob you've got years ago why stop high priced the job that i stopped watching the evening people my age is to watch the bad news for my liberator that led to the idea that i messed up watching his alice alice to learn to throw my chute failed to prove it's great because you know the reporters they would dart very much like the politicians they would report on the immediate effect over the middle ages going around and said that that means a little better ways to both you know one of the well this is wall point doesn't it means that someone has been is also all the workers of the loss of jobs hot summer jobs with a major those jobs going to change and for his orders to sit back and say oh well that they hire their own way you so was just bernard in which where's the money coming from worth of resources coming from the capital from somewhere yeah so basically your argument would be that the government only role in the economy is to make sure we're not killing each other pretty mock trial eighty really if it's a total laissez faire active yes i'm utterly sincere guy if this property rights or will befall and then sick you were then the strong case to go over please roll okay nuclear war in helping to the following day and serving helping to secure property rights or so that we're not on drug lords right to have forgotten that are put out her i thought that got close to her and i i i'm alwaleed i'm willing to admit that rug right in the doing that to the one where the arsenal into the malibu capitalism you might not be a bold we get the defensible position i'm not willing to that that free markets are an indefensible position however property rights come to be aware that they would find however they are forged when you have to suck you were private property rights and freedom of contract which includes importantly the freedom to say no but i decision to not contract but by then keyboard wanted to pursue their people in pursuing a low interest are obliged to help others out and that's how this great society that we live and it is great book continues to grow and become more prosperous yeah so i met you were before we started that you know i've had a political awakening of sorts where we say that i really move but the left when sober bananas i ended up being principal these libertarian conservative whatever whatever it is even for the difference is we may have one please i have shifted is that i am much more were you are economically now and partly that's because i know we're on my own business and have employees and have to deal with that and i just room to seeing lehigh checks for taxes for your migliore california the hallam i've found was the federal is even worse as iq the more successful i get the horror i work the more they wanted speak from you and i treated something about that on tax day how lot of people angry at me and said well it's it's this is the price to pay for success would you rather be pool or an idea what won a major tweezers or maybe wisely you're not on twitter boyd predicted gimme something that if i ever get mad fight again i can say to people why that's not really think so will the midst all food is as to the herd the the story about george mcgovern when he retired from politics he loved it so pleased to sir george mcgovern he retired from politics and have the details right he asserted that the major portrait he started b. b. by the lapd in his home state or electorate is gonna have that back but as that he encounters stall the fluctuations in labour regulations safety relations but then he didn't get secular now to whom he does a long time ago bracket he he admits he has spent all my pee on my quoting him on that drew boyd for every test and all my life pushing for these things that i was house is sufficiently that if a to that house side of all of those though these taxes in the river you wish to happen but so it's easy to steal to sit in sacramento the city washington d. c. to sit and some will will government office buildings and tell the people have alluded to tell the people with money they have to give to you you can be well intentioned and best sense of the term up but you would not those of the people and those are the people during consequences of a hill of things are you available understood as so called on the one that all that on the tax thing about like what the law firm it korn said about the the famous quotation unusable with the war the virus billy washington is a quotation from justice of twelve wendell holmes said nothing's example tuition tax issues abortion unfeasible solution and increases the risk of petrol taxation is the price we pay you for being insufficiently civil wars have been cut but this is civilization is is when we cooperate peacefully to help the job and this we've agreed that there is some role for government what should lead to some role for government to the jury difficult to do not see you this gym appropriate level of taxation to fallen by the role for government about why we're much that may be true that we need that that it represents a failure of doses of society to become for civilize who somehow not manage to figure out how to cooperate peacefully in voluntarily in those matters ways we have managed to discover the cooperate peacefully involuntarily idling would do it today inglewood to the supermarket was awarded dealing with the various o. of suppliers of that that it has none of that is is founded with answers all filled with voluntary altered things that is civilizations are a lot like the notion that the poet taxation views of it's a case of a measure of how little we were so watch out for we have to go to the caboose of office to make sure we're not challenge that eventually led to it at get out so i don't get back to a couple things you said they're so first okay i know that either the minimum wage is it is a big one for us to just this morning for another story about albert what's this fifteen dollar minimum wage and to go there keep using very good at it using is that i keep trying traveling all over the country right now and in almost every airport you going fast food places and they don't have people anymore they have a pipettes it's now perhaps if you could pay people less people would have jobs that would be the greatest job in the world that would be the way it's always worked have now we are and really replacing people with robots that may be inevitable no matter what what to say that you have to pay people in that for my own business here i get people often to work for me for the all the time i wanted people to really deal they'll be able to baum but the idea that the government would force me to paying someone x. amount seems completely but it yet so the minimum wage put school manual skill workers are no jobs if give about a teenager is not worth seven dollars and twenty five cents per hour employers were not in the jury business are not going to hire the teenager at the port city of double gold blowjob would go without a job in the in the above ground because they movement on the job paying more in the wrong underground comic wit to the defense are problems by and so that is the major unintended consequence of the middle which they're they're opposed to that that's the big one up and give out at people are bernie sanders midlife speak to proponents of the minimum wage all the talk bout with most of them do they just off the analysis that that the surface all want to be better to get the shifting also are the support of course that says if they don't get to the unintended consequence power that ticket i think because i think because most of them believe that they just had this image of employers is being really rich a highly profitable operations and so to raise the minimum wage i'm sure is a cost is the cost of the war exclusively by employers it but it's a fact most low skilled workers work in highly competitive industries are working full of material that knew they were putting on kia there to me were given him in it's simple mortgage restaurants of the highly competitive industries to this no big profit margin there so you raise the minimum wage is not coming on the profits of the employers have to come out of some change with employers do their business something wrong information course yeah but don't deserve that the proper amount of formation and if you raise the minimum wage you get to watch our nation but because people get a cut that too few human workers and get his consort with a clue is another element of the consequence of the middle which not only does he deny you come to those workers who lose jobs worse in most cases it denies those workers but it was even more valuable they were the opportunity to get that first piece of job experience with the so the sixteen year old ones who got the job without the minimum wage becomes a seventeen your eighty year old who still they never enjoyed person were zobel was it would've had job experience facility it swells politician swells the rights of of both o. unskilled workers who they are the indirectly religion than that once you have this whole set of people at this imaginary fifteen army which the rules of the new raise prices on basic tried this is their first record relation now though i'd check prices there was a little bit should get into the cotton club was sufficient isolde it was all put but the price increases on board the the major problem the major problem is employers will find ways to satisfy their customers but slightly higher cost to the employers been a huge cost to those workers who lose their jobs so you've talked to economists on the left for that disagree with you on this night the idea we're saying that they're not taking that except i'm sure there's someone out there and have made it sound argued that you just disagree with the norwegian layouts would ask the so there is one sound or give bill one south few radically because they weren't coherent order for them and had such a valid that is if employers have what's called monotony power they had macho u. to buy their own yes mounted power it is like monopoly power to the mouth of his only sell or obnoxious is the only body or regret so if you're the only guy or twelve miles to workers in the mortgage on the u. was an employer you then get in to be easily shown you can keep wages no within it would otherwise be none too low and given that you became even show that the government comes in it's it's a minimum wage and then the bow of the employer will in fact a the higher minimum wage and no employees will be hard but it's a very very stoned on strict to get the criteria of our strength and the idea that that wall more to dolls and burger king in kiev see all the big mom and pop rushed on some hope nobody in the services of one care services that we have throw be nice if the idea that any one of these is a monopoly home monopoly by your bubbles to workers used absolute and i and time on hoped i
