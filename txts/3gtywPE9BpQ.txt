dislike it away our recognizes that would still part of the polling looks for the media leads to political leaves blows that there are people live and in places that they never go home and those people i think voted for down from that probably they like to that did not agree with john but everything else so that they are they are hard to suggesting that the mainstream media in this godfrey ms topol so that people without a doubt that they they they rat hole in the civil rights of the fact is so going out and doing the ground while i mean how can donald sarong we have but so ross perot not

was her heart get that story and talk to our subchapter attacked a shirt on a couple of people is certainly no dogs and union leaders affected by doctor sonya that under shelter and so the bottom line is don't take a lot of work to get deal is not claiming great genius of water on it also as got closer i got from bid on so many disqualifying things that i didn't anticipate that the work on the riyadh in which actively on your estimate is that awful lot of people are working at level that makes him will you except an oligarchy septa the billionaires where will our calls and they don't like that was the lawson's and say you know what this is a change agent is not washington he's an outsider he has created jobs what's given the chances that doesn't that sound a bit and at last has two
